<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>I fear that the patience of those who have been awaiting this little book must be well-nigh exhausted,
so long has it been in appearing. I began it two years ago, but had to put it aside
during the last few months spent in India prior to taking furlough, on account of the
heavy work the threatening famine entailed; and when one is on furlough one only works
at the rare times when there is nothing better to do!</p>
<p>The object of this book is to enable people interested in our Indian birds to identify at
sight those they are likely to meet with in their compounds and during their excursions
into the jungle.</p>
<p>There are several good systematic works on Indian ornithology, but the descriptions in
these presuppose that the reader has the specimen in his hand and is able to examine
it leisurely, feather by feather. To do this it is necessary to kill the bird in question&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
procedure which causes pain to many and gives pleasure to very few. Moreover,
unless the seeker after knowledge has some notion as to the order to which the bird he
has shot belongs, he will find that seeking it out in the four bird volumes of the <i>Fauna of
British India</i> series is a task almost as hopeless as that of looking for the proverbial needle in
a haystack.</p>
<p>Eha&rsquo;s truly admirable book, entitled <i>The Common Birds of Bombay</i>, gives the reader a
vivid description of our common Indian birds as they appear to the field naturalist; and I
heartily commend this little masterpiece to every Anglo-Indian. But even this does not
enable the observer to identify in a few seconds any bird he sees, for it is not written
in the form of a key. The present book is an attempt at a key to the everyday birds of the
plains of India, a dictionary of birds so arranged that the budding ornithologist is able to turn
up any particular bird in a few minutes. This book is, I believe, the first of its kind
that has been attempted.</p>
<p>The method I have adopted is to classify birds according to their habits and outward
appearance. Every bird has a colour, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
most birds possess some anatomical peculiarity, such as a crest, a long tail, long legs, etc.
Not a few have some easily recognisable habit, such as a peculiar call or manner of flight.
Thus most birds will appear in at least two of my classes, and so should be easily identified
by a process of elimination. When the reader thinks that he has located a bird he should
turn it up in the descriptive list, which composes Part II of this book, and this will serve
to confirm or correct him in his identification. Thus, to take a very easy example, the observer
while out walking sees a white bird with a long tail, and a black crested head. Looking
through the lists of birds under (1) those having long tails; (2) those having a crest; (3) those
mainly white, he will find that the Paradise Flycatcher is the only bird that appears in
all three lists. Its number in the descriptive list is (<a class="rb" href="#bird_57">57</a>). A perusal of entry No. 57 will
confirm the diagnosis, and indicate where illustrations of the bird are to be found.</p>
<p>I venture to hope that this little book will enable any person to learn in a few weeks to
identify nearly all the common birds of his station.</p>
<p>The descriptions given in Part II of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
book are short ones, and each is an attempt to depict the bird as it looks when perched in
a tree or during flight. Sometimes the description given may appear to differ from
those given in <i>The Fauna of British India</i>, or in Jerdon&rsquo;s <i>Birds of India</i>. The reason of the
apparent discrepancy is that the descriptions of the birds in these latter books are those of
the skins of dead birds, while mine are attempts to depict the bird as he appears in
the flesh.</p>
<p>In a few cases I have described birds from memory, and sometimes my memory may
have played me false. I shall be most grateful to anyone who will be kind enough to
point out to me any errors. One of the greatest of the difficulties I have experienced
is to know what birds to insert and what to leave out of this book. It is a key only to the
common birds of the plains, and deals with about one-fifth of the feathered inhabitants.</p>
<p>I have purposely omitted the game birds from my list. These are usually shot at sight;
it is therefore not necessary for me to burden this book with them. There is no lack of good
books that enable the sportsman to identify the birds he has shot. I may mention Marshall
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and Hume&rsquo;s <i>Game Birds of India, Burmah, and Ceylon</i>, with its large number of coloured
plates. This valuable work is out of print; but a copy is to be found in almost every Indian
library. Then there is Stuart Baker&rsquo;s recently published <i>Indian Ducks and their Allies</i>, which
contains excellent coloured plates of all Indian ducks. Those who cannot afford to purchase
this sumptuous work have in Finn&rsquo;s <i>How to know the Indian Ducks</i>, a safe and inexpensive
guide. The same author&rsquo;s <i>How to know the Indian Waders</i>, enables the tyro to identify
any dead wader. Lastly, there is Le Messurier&rsquo;s <i>Game, Shore, and Water Birds of India</i>;
but this, I fear, will be found rather technical for most people. I think I have stated sufficiently
clearly my reasons for excluding the majority of game birds from the present work.
It now remains for me to justify the other omissions.</p>
<p>In order to render it comparatively easy to identify any given bird, it is necessary that
the various classes shall not be too large, and the only way of securing this desideratum is to
exclude all the birds that are not frequently met with.</p>
<p>Some may think that I have omitted certain
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
species that should have been included. In anticipation of such criticism I may say that
I have done my best to deal impartially with my feathered friends. I have served in three
provinces, viz. the United Provinces, Madras, and the Punjab, and have spent a little time
on the Bombay side, and have been largely guided by my experience. It is, I admit, quite
likely that some of the birds I have omitted may be very common in certain localities. I
shall be glad to hear of any such with a view to adding them to a second edition should
that be called for.</p>
<p>I would emphasise the fact that this book is a mere key, and as such is of necessity a collection
of the dry bones of ornithology and devoid of any literary merit. The book will lose
much of its value unless it be used in conjunction with other books, such as Jerdon&rsquo;s
<i>Birds of India</i>, or the bird volumes of the <i>Fauna of British India</i> series, to which
references are made in the case of every species mentioned. The present work is
primarily a companion to either of the above volumes.</p>
<p>When once the common birds have been learned, it becomes comparatively easy to
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
identify the uncommon ones and to assign to its proper family an uncommon bird.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me advise every one who wishes to &ldquo;learn his birds&rdquo;
to procure Eha&rsquo;s <i>Common Birds of Bombay</i>. Most of the species dealt
with therein are common all over the plains.</p>
<p>Those who live in Calcutta will find Cunningham&rsquo;s
<i>Some Indian Friends and Acquaintances</i>,
and Finn&rsquo;s <i>Birds of Calcutta</i> very helpful.</p>
<p>Although I have, in the present work, indicated the distribution of the various birds
dealt with, a local list (where it exists) will be of great assistance. The following lists
have been compiled:</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small">PREFACE<br /><span class="small">TO THE SECOND EDITION</span></span></h2>
<p>The first edition of this work was exhausted a year before I became aware of the fact, and,
as the demand appears to be brisk, I have not caused further delay by revising the book very
thoroughly.</p>
<p>I am under considerable obligation to Mr. G. O. Allen, <span class="small">I.C.S.</span>, for his notes and suggestions.
Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that the list of additions and corrections has
been almost entirely compiled by him.</p>
<p>It is a source of great satisfaction to me to learn that this little book, notwithstanding
its shortcomings, has enabled many people to learn the names of the common birds that
live around them.</p>

<p>Colour affords the easiest means of identifying
the great majority of birds, but in many
cases the colours displayed, although conspicuous
and easily recognised, are not of a
nature to admit of strict classification. Take,
for example, the blues&mdash;various species display
almost every known shade from slaty grey to
turquoise, from purple to ultramarine and
indigo. To attempt to distinguish in the
lists between the many shades of blue would
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
have led to inevitable confusion. I have,
therefore, divided my blues into bright blue,
dark blue, and slaty blue. My method is
probably inartistic, but it will, I hope, facilitate
the task of identification.</p>
<p>Again, it is no easy matter to draw the line
between greyish and brownish birds, hence
I have included some species under both
heads. The reader should bear in mind that,
while nothing is easier than to identify some
birds by their colour, in the case of others
colour is at the best a rough guide&mdash;one, but
only one, of the clues which have to be followed
up before the identity of the species can
be established. In the case of Raptorial birds
colour is of very little assistance, since the
great majority of them are of the same colour,
moreover, individuals vary greatly in colouration
at different stages of their existence.</p>

<h3 id="c13">III. BROWN</h3>
<p>The number of birds of which the predominating hue is brownish is very considerable,
and as these usually have nothing striking about their appearance, they are among the
most difficult birds to identify. Birds which appear to be a uniform earthy brown will be
found on closer inspection almost invariably to be brighter in hue below than above. This
is largely counteracted by the fact that the lower parts are in the shade. Most birds
which look a uniform earthy brown are in reality a cream colour below, and are described
as such in systematic works on ornithology. But as this book is intended for the field
naturalist, I shall describe them as they appear to the ordinary observer.</p>
<h4>1. <i>Birds whose general hue is earthy brown</i></h4>
<h5>(<i>a</i>) <i>Those smaller than the sparrow</i></h5>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. The Indian Tailor Bird (<a class="rb" href="#bird_28">28</a>). (This flits about among the leaves. The note is a loud <i>to-wee, to-wee, to-wee</i>. When the bird calls a small black band may be seen at each side of the neck. In the breeding season the two middle tail feathers of the cock grow over an inch longer than the others and project beyond them like bristles. A very familiar wren-like bird. The brown has a greenish tint.)</dt>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</dt>
<dt>2. Sykes&rsquo;s Tree-warbler (<a class="rb" href="#bird_29">29</a>). (Not unlike a solidly built wren, with a tail of average length, and not short like that of the wren.)</dt>
<dt>3. The Streaked Wren-warbler (<a class="rb" href="#bird_30">30</a>). (This is distinguished from other warblers by the fact that its upper plumage is streaked with dark brown.)</dt>
<dt>4. The Ashy Wren-warbler (<a class="rb" href="#bird_31">31</a>). (Makes a curious snapping noise as it flits about the bushes.)</dt>
<dt>5. The Indian Wren-warblers (<a class="rb" href="#bird_32">32</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_33">33</a>). (Slender and loosely-knit, and make no snapping noise.)</dt>
<dt>6. The Brown Flycatcher (<a class="rb" href="#bird_55">55</a>). (Characterised by its short tail and the fact that it constantly makes little sallies into the air after insects.)</dt>
<dt>7. (Hen) Indian Bush Chat (<a class="rb" href="#bird_63">63</a>). (Reddish brown. Cock quite differently coloured.)</dt>
<dt>8. The White-throated Munia (<a class="rb" href="#bird_76">76</a>). (Very thick bill, white throat and rump, and a note like the twitter of the sparrow; usually seen in small flocks.)</dt>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</dt>
<dt>9. The Indian Sand-martin (<a class="rb" href="#bird_86">86</a>). (Swallow-like flight; nests in sandbanks.)</dt>
<dt>10. The Dusky Crag-martin (<a class="rb" href="#bird_87">87</a>). (Swallow-like flight; builds mud nest.)</dt>
<dt>11. (Hen) Sunbirds (<a class="rb" href="#bird_106">106</a>-<a class="rb" href="#bird_108">108</a>). (Pale yellow under parts, longish curved bill, sometimes hovers in the air on rapidly vibrating wings. Cocks gaily coloured.)</dt></dl>
<h5>(<i>b</i>) <i>The size of, or a little larger than, the sparrow</i></h5>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. The Common Babbler (<a class="rb" href="#bird_6">6</a>). (A brown bird with a number of dark streaks. As it runs along it carries its tail along the ground, hence its name, &ldquo;The Rat Bird.&rdquo;)</dt>
<dt>2. The White-browed Bulbul (<a class="rb" href="#bird_22">22</a>). (Pale yellow patch under the tail, white eyebrow. It has a very cheery call.)</dt>
<dt>3. The Common Woodshrike (<a class="rb" href="#bird_38">38</a>). (Broad white eyebrow, outer tail feathers white; a pretty mellow note&mdash;<i>tanti tuia</i>.)</dt>
<dt>4. (Hen) Pied Bush Chat (<a class="rb" href="#bird_61">61</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_62">62</a>). (Reddish brown, with black tail; cock more strikingly coloured.)</dt>
<dt>5. The Brown Rock Chat (<a class="rb" href="#bird_64">64</a>). (Robin-like in habits; continually bobs its head.)</dt>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</dt>
<dt>6. (Hen) Indian Robins (<a class="rb" href="#bird_67">67</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_68">68</a>). (Brick-red patch under tail. Tail often carried erect.)</dt>
<dt>7. Weaver Birds (<a class="rb" href="#bird_70">70</a>-<a class="rb" href="#bird_73">73</a>). (Stout bill. Cock becomes showy in breeding season.)</dt>
<dt>8. (Hen) Rose Finch (<a class="rb" href="#bird_80">80</a>). (Two white bars in wing.)</dt>
<dt>9. Yellow-throated sparrow (<a class="rb" href="#bird_81">81</a>). (Yellow patch on throat.)</dt>
<dt>10. (Hen) Common Sparrow (<a class="rb" href="#bird_82">82</a>).</dt>
<dt>11. The Grey-necked Bunting (<a class="rb" href="#bird_83">83</a>). (Thickish bill, some dark streaks in plumage and white in tail.)</dt>
<dt>12. (Hen) Black-headed Bunting (<a class="rb" href="#bird_84">84</a>). (Dull yellow under parts and bright yellow patch under the tail.)</dt>
<dt>13. The Pipits (<a class="rb" href="#bird_95">95</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_96">96</a>). (Longish legs; dark streaks in plumage. Feed on ground, but take refuge in trees when disturbed.)</dt>
<dt>14. The Larks (<a class="rb" href="#bird_97">97</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_98">98</a>). (Feed on ground; never perch in trees; some soar in the air and sing.)</dt>
<dt>15. The Bush Larks (<a class="rb" href="#bird_99">99</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_100">100</a>). (Distinguished from the true larks in perching in bushes when they sometimes take short flights into the air. Distinguished from the pipits in having no white in the tail.)</dt>
<dt>16. The Crested Larks (<a class="rb" href="#bird_101">101</a>-<a class="rb" href="#bird_103">103</a>). (Feed on ground; sing in air; never perch in bushes. Crested heads; no white in tail.)</dt>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</dt>
<dt>17. The Common Wryneck (<a class="rb" href="#bird_112">112</a>). (Woodpecker-like habits. It twists its head from side to side continually. Its plumage is much streaked, speckled, and spotted.)</dt>
<dt>18. The Spotted Owlet (<a class="rb" href="#bird_135">135</a>). (Plumage much spotted and barred with white. Eyes in front of head. Comes out at sunset and sets up a loud chuckling chatter. Legs feathered to the toes.)</dt>
<dt>19. The Scops Owl (<a class="rb" href="#bird_138">138</a>). (Differs from the Spotted Owlet in having &ldquo;horns&rdquo; or ear-tufts. Note a single hoot, which is repeated regularly at intervals of about ten seconds.)</dt>
<dt>20. The Jungle Owlet (<a class="rb" href="#bird_139">139</a>). (Distinguished from the Spotted Owlet by its call and by the fact that it is far less often seen.)</dt>
<dt>21. The Kentish Plover (<a class="rb" href="#bird_185">185</a>). (White collar. Found in flocks on the sea coasts.)</dt>
<dt>22. The Little Ringed Plover (<a class="rb" href="#bird_186">186</a>). (Like the Kentish Plover, but distinguished from it by having a black band across the white throat.)</dt>
<dt>23. The Little Stint. (Wading birds, which occur in large flocks on shallow water.)</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<h5>(<i>c</i>) <i>About the size of a myna</i></h5>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. The Jungle Babbler (<a class="rb" href="#bird_7">7</a>). (An untidy-looking bird, which goes about in small flocks of half a dozen, feeding on the ground; very noisy; flight feeble.)</dt>
<dt>2. The White-headed Babbler (<a class="rb" href="#bird_8">8</a>). (As above, but the crown of the head is greyish white. Found only in S. India.)</dt>
<dt>3. The Rufous-tailed Babbler (<a class="rb" href="#bird_9">9</a>). (Habits like those of the two species just cited; tail has a reddish tinge.)</dt>

<p>Since habits of birds vary according to
circumstances, none of the lists given are
exhaustive. They merely serve as rough
guides. Thus, if a nest be found in the compound
it is in all probability the nest of one
of the species set forth in the list given, but it
may, of course, belong to some other species.
The list is nevertheless useful, as out of twenty
nests found in any garden in the plains nineteen
of them will also certainly belong to birds set
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
forth in my list. Having determined that a
given bird in all probability belongs to one of
these species, it should not be difficult to
arrive at its name by a process of elimination.</p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>
<p>F. stands for <i>The Fauna of British India</i>, and
the number which follows indicates the number
of the bird in <i>The Fauna of British India</i>.
J. stands for Jerdon&rsquo;s <i>Birds of India</i>, and the
number that follows indicates the number of
the bird in Jerdon&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>In describing a bird its size is a matter of
importance as an aid to identification; but as
the statement that a bird is six inches in length
probably does not convey to the average person
a definite idea of its size, I have adopted
another system of indicating the size of each
bird described. I have taken five standards of
size, each being that of a familiar bird, and
have described each species in terms of these
standards, which are:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<dl class="undent"><dt><span class="cn">I. </span>The common sparrow, 6 inches in length.</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">II. </span>The bulbul, 8-9 inches in length.</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">III. </span>The myna, 10 inches in length.</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">IV. </span>The Indian house crow, 17&frac12; ins. in length.</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">V. </span>The kite, 23 inches in length.</dt></dl>
<p>My system is as follows. If A be a bird of
which the length is 5 inches, I affix in a bracket
-I, which means that is a bird smaller than a
sparrow; if it be 6 inches in length I affix
simply I; if it be 7 inches in length I affix +I,
denoting that it is larger than a sparrow, but
smaller than a bulbul, and nearer to the sparrow
than the bulbul in dimensions; had its
length been 7&frac12; inches I should have described
it as -II, i.e. rather smaller than a bulbul.
By these means he who consults this book will
at once be able to form a rough conception of
the size of each species described. Those who
desire more details will find them in <i>The
Fauna of British India</i>. In this connection
it is worthy of mention that certain small
birds, as, for example, the adult cock paradise
flycatcher, have very long tails. Such a bird,
if measured from the tip of his beak to the end
of his tail (as ornithologists usually do), would
have to be described as -V, i.e. as a bird
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
rather smaller than a kite, but this would convey
a very misleading idea of the magnitude
of the bird, the body of which is about the
same size as that of the bulbul. I shall accordingly
describe the paradise flycatcher as II,
i.e. a bird of the same size as the bulbul, but
shall note that the cock has a very long tail.</p>
<p>In cases where birds build very characteristic
nests or have very characteristic songs or
habits, I shall mention these as aids to identification.
It must be remembered that this
little book is not a natural history of birds,
but merely a key to the identification of our
commoner Indian feathered friends. Having
identified a bird, the reader should refer to
some other writer for information regarding
its habits, etc.</p>
<p>In order to simplify identification I shall
roughly indicate the distribution of each
species. If nothing is said about the distribution
of any bird this means that it may be
found anywhere in the plains of India. If a
species occurs in all parts save one or more the
words &ldquo;Not found in &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; will occur in
the description. If the distribution be local,
the description will contain the words &ldquo;Found
in &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>As a further aid to identification I have, in all cases in which a species has been figured in
any book which is easily procurable, stated where the picture of the bird is to be found.
Most stations in India boast of a library of sorts, which is likely to contain some, at any
rate, of the books referred to. In order to save space I have used abbreviations for the
titles. Thus (Illus. F. I., p. 298) means that a picture of the bird in question will be found
on page 298 of Volume I of the bird volume of <i>The Fauna of British India</i>.</p>

<h3 class="genus"><i>The Crows</i>, 1-4</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_1">1</a>. <i>Corvus machrorhynchus</i>: The Jungle Crow or the Indian Corby. (F. 4), (J. 660), (+IV.)</p>
<p>Glossy black all over. Nests from March to
May. Nest a large structure placed high up in
a tree. Not found in the N.W. Punjab, where
it is replaced by the next species. (Illus. B. D.,
p. 60; also B. B., p. 117, and I. F., p. 61.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_2">2</a>. <i>Corvus corax</i>: The Raven. (F. 1), (J. 657), (V.)</p>
<p>Glossy black all over. Found only in the N.W.F. province and the western parts of
the Punjab.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_3">3</a>. <i>Corvus splendens</i>: The Indian House
Crow, or the Grey-necked Crow. (F. 7), (J. 663), (IV.)</p>
<p>Like a jackdaw in marking and appearance.
Glossy black, except for nape, neck, upper
back and breast, which are ashy brown. (The
hue of this ashy brown varies considerably
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
with the locality, being lightest in the Punjab.)
Nesting season May to July, or later. Nest
like that of 1. In Burma this species is replaced
by the next. (Illus. B. D., p. 168; also
B. P., p. 190, and B. B., p. 117.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_4">4</a>. <i>Corvus insolens</i>: The Burmese House
Crow. (F. 8), (IV.)</p>
<p>A form of <i>C. splendens</i> in which the neck
plumage is nearly as dark as that of the other
parts.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_5">5</a>. <i>Dendrocitta rufa</i>: The Indian Tree-pie. (F. 16), (J. 674), (+II, but with tail a foot in length.)</p>
<p>Head, neck, and breast brownish black;
body chestnut; silver-grey on the wings. Tail
greyish with broad black band at the tip.
During flight the tail assumes a curious shape
owing to the fact that the feathers which
compose it are graduated in length; the
median pair is twelve inches long, the next
pair is shorter, and so on, the outer pair being
only about half the length of the median pair.
This bird has a curious metallic call which
may be syllabised <i>coch-lee, coch-lee</i>, or <i>cogee,
cogee</i>. It also emits a great variety of harsh
cries. Breeds from April to August. The
nest is a large cup high up in a tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>(Does not appear to occur in or about the
towns of Bombay and Madras.) (Illus. B. C.,
p. 10, but the illustration is not a good one, a
better idea is given in F. I., p. 10, where an
allied species is figured.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Babblers</i>, 6-10</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_6">6</a>. <i>Argya caudata</i>: The Common Babbler, or Striated Bush-babbler, or Rat-bird. (F. 105), (J. 438), (II.)</p>
<p>A dingy brown bird; upper plumage darker than the lower. In each feather there is a
dark line along the shaft which causes the bird to have a streaked appearance. It goes about
in pairs, or in small flocks. It feeds largely on the ground. When it runs, its tail (which is
about 4&frac12; inches long, i.e. half the total length of the bird) seems to trail on the ground like
that of a rat, hence one of its names. Its note is not unpleasant. It nests chiefly in the hot
weather. The nursery is a neatly constructed cup, which is invariably placed in a low bush.
Its eggs are pale blue.</p>
<p>Does not appear to occur in the neighbourhood of Calcutta, Bombay, or Madras. Addicted
to arid parts of India.</p>
<p>7-9. <i>The Crateropus Babblers, or &ldquo;Seven Sisters.&rdquo;</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>These are all untidy-looking, earthy-brown birds about the size of mynas. They go about
in little flocks, whence the name &ldquo;Seven Sisters,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>Sath Bhai</i>.&rdquo; They feed largely
on the ground, seeking for insects among dead leaves. While feeding they keep up a constant
chatter which every now and then grows very loud, sounding like a combination of a squeak
and the groans of a revolving axle that requires to be oiled. They continually jerk the tail,
which has the appearance of being very loosely inserted. So untidy-looking are these birds that
Eha likens them to &ldquo;Old Jones, who spends the day in his pyjamas.&rdquo; Their flight is feeble and
laborious. Three species are common:</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_7">7</a>. <i>Crateropus canorus</i>: The Jungle Babbler. (F. 110), (J. 432), (III.)</p>
<p>This bird is abundant in Northern India,
and becomes rarer in the south, where it is
largely replaced in the plains by the two next
species. (Illus. B. C., p. 15.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Allahabad the Large Grey Babbler (<i>Argya malcomi</i>)
(F. 107) or <i>Gangai</i>, is more abundant even than <i>C. canorus</i>.
It may be recognised by its long tail. The three outer pairs
of tail feathers are white&mdash;very conspicuous during flight.
The note is a loud harsh <i>quey, quey, quey</i>. The bird is
commoner than I thought. It occurs in most districts of
the U.P.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_8">8</a>. <i>Crateropus griseus</i>: The White-headed Babbler. (F. 111), (J. 433), (III.)</p>
<p>This is the common babbler of the Madras presidency. It is easily recognised by the
greyish white crown of its head. (Illus. B. D., p. 204.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_9">9</a>. <i>Crateropus somervillii</i>: The Rufous-tailed Babbler. (F. 113), (J. 435), (III.)</p>
<p>The common babbler of Bombay and Poona. It is the least untidy-looking of the
babblers, and may be recognised by the distinctly reddish hue of its tail.</p>
<p>All three species of babblers build neat cup-shaped nests not far above the ground and
lay beautiful blue eggs. (Illus. B. B., p. 80.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_10">10</a>. <i>Pyctorhis sinensis</i>: The Yellow-eyed Babbler. (F. 139), (J. 385), (+I.)</p>
<p>This is considerably smaller than the other babblers described. Its general colour is
cinnamon brown. The eyebrows, throat, and breast are white. The under parts are cream-coloured.
The eye is bright yellow. It emits a sweet note and builds a beautiful nest. This
last is in shape not unlike the hat worn by a political officer in full dress. It measures
about five inches in depth and is usually slung by its broadest part on to two or more growing
reeds, heads of millet, stout grass stems, or perhaps more frequently to a forked branch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_11">11</a>. <i>Myiophoneus horsfieldi</i>: The Malabar Whistling Thrush, or Idle Schoolboy. (F. 189), (J. 342), (+III.)</p>
<p>A black bird with large cobalt blue patches on the forehead and the wings. Small patches
of the same hue occur on other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Not found in the N.W. Frontier Province, the Punjab, United Provinces, Bengal, or the
eastern portion of Madras. Usually occurs in the neighbourhood of shaded streams. Its
note is a striking whistle.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_12">12</a>. <i>Zosterops palpebrosa</i>: The Indian White-eye, or Spectacle Bird. (F. 226), (J. 631), (-I.)</p>
<p>A greenish yellow bird, with bright yellow
throat and a patch of yellow under the tail.
The rest of the lower plumage is greyish
white. The most noticeable feature of the
bird is a ring of white feathers round the eye.
Hence its popular name. White-eyes go about
in large flocks; they feed largely on insects
which they pick from off the leaves of trees.
Each individual utters unceasingly a cheeping
note. At the nesting season, which is usually
at the beginning of the hot weather, the cock
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
sings a sweet little song. The nest is a beautiful
little cup suspended from a forked branch.
Two pale blue eggs are usually laid. (Illus.
G. B., p. 96.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_13">13</a>. <i>&AElig;githina tiphia</i>: The Common Iora. (F. 243), (J. 468), (-I.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: (<i>a</i>) In summer upper plumage, wings,
and tail are black; lower parts bright yellow.
There are two white bars in the wing.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) In winter the black parts of the head and
back are replaced by yellowish green.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Upper parts, wings, and tail green;
lower parts yellow. Two white bars in the
wing.</p>
<p>This species has a sweet song. It does not occur in the Frontier Province or the
Punjab. &ldquo;A little bird,&rdquo; writes Eha, &ldquo;like a tomtit, in black and yellow, followed by its
mate in green and yellow, can be nothing else than the Iora.&rdquo; Builds at the beginning of
the hot weather a very neat and tiny cup-shaped nest. (Illus. B. B., p. 91, also G. B.,
p. 64.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Bulbuls</i>, 14-22</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_14">14</a>. <i>Chloropsis Jerdoni.</i> The Common Green
Bulbul, or Jerdon&rsquo;s Chloropsis. (F. 252), (J. 463), (-II.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>A beautiful emerald green bird. There is a patch of yellow on the forehead. The cock
has the sides of the head, chin, and throat black, and a purple-blue moustache. The
black of the male is replaced by bluish green in the hen.</p>
<p>Does not occur in the Frontier Province, the Punjab, Rajputana, Bengal, or the northern
and western portions of the United Provinces. It is essentially a bird of Central and Southern
India, but rare on the east coast. It affects well-wooded parts of the country. (Illus. G.
B., p. 96.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Red-vented Bulbuls</i>, 15-18</h3>
<p>Head black with short crest; remainder of
plumage brown, each feather having a narrow
margin of a lighter hue. The tail is tipped
with white, and there is a white patch above
the tail. A conspicuous crimson patch under
the tail. Bulbuls go about in pairs and constantly
emit a cheery note. They build neat
cup-shaped nests, frequently in plants in the
verandahs of houses. When the nest is
approached by a human being the parent birds
set up a loud chattering. These bulbuls occur
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
all over India, but ornithologists divide them
into several species:</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_15">15</a>. <i>Molpastes h&aelig;morrhous</i>: The Madras Red-vented Bulbul. (F. 278), (J. 462), (II.)</p>
<p>The common bulbul of South India, as far North as Lucknow. (Illus. B. D., p. 296; also B. B., p. 87.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_16">16</a>. <i>Molpastes burmanicus</i>: The Burmese Red-vented Bulbul. (F. 279), (II.)</p>
<p>The common bulbul of Burma.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_17">17</a>. <i>Molpastes bengalensis</i>: The Bengal Red-vented Bulbul. (F. 282), (J. 461), (II.)</p>
<p>The common bulbul of Eastern Oudh, the Bengals, and Assam. (Illus. B. C., p. 22.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_18">18</a>. <i>Molpastes intermedius</i>: The Punjab Red-vented Bulbul. (F. 283), (J. II., p. 95) (II.)</p>
<p>The common bulbul of the Frontier Province, the Punjab, and the province of Agra.</p>
<p>[At the points where the various species or
races of red-vented bulbuls meet they interbreed,
so that at Lucknow and other points of
junction it is not possible to assign the local
bulbuls to any of the above species.]</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_19">19</a>. <i>Molpastes leucotis</i>: The White-eared Bulbul. (F. 285), (J. 459), (-II.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>This species differs from the Red-vented
Bulbuls in its somewhat smaller size, its
shorter crest and in having a large white patch
on each side of the head, and the patch of
feathers under the tail yellow instead of
crimson.</p>
<p>Found only in the north-west portion of
India. In the cold weather its range extends
into the Province of Agra and the C. P., but in
the spring it migrates to the west and breeds in
Sind, the Frontier Province, and the Western
Districts of the Punjab. Its nests have also been
taken in Rajputana, Katywar, and Cutch. (Illus.
G. B., p. 96; also F. I., p. 252.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Red-whiskered Bulbuls,</i> 20 <i>and</i> 21</h3>
<p>These sprightly and handsome birds are
characterised by their long crests, which end
in a point and project forward, like Mr.
Punch&rsquo;s cap. The head and crest are black,
but each cheek is characterised by a large
white and a small crimson patch, hence the
name &ldquo;red-whiskered.&rdquo; The upper plumage
is earthy brown. The tail feathers are somewhat
darker brown and are tipped with white.
The breast and lower plumage are white. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
breast is separated from the abdomen by a
conspicuous band of black feathers known as
the collaret. There is a crimson patch of
feathers under the tail.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_20">20</a>. <i>Otocompsa emeria</i>: The Bengal Red-whiskered
Bulbul. (F. 288), (J. 460), (II.)</p>
<p>Found in Northern and Eastern India, and
Burma. (Illus. B. P., p. 230; also B. C., p. 26.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_21">21</a>. <i>Otocompsa fuscicaudata</i>: The Southern
Red-whiskered Bulbul. (F. 289), (J. 460), (II.)</p>
<p>Found chiefly in the south-western portion
of India, more especially in the hills. This is
the common bulbul of all our South-Indian
hill stations.</p>
<p>This species is distinguishable from <i>Emeria</i>
in that it has a complete collaret. In <i>Emeria</i>
the black collaret is interrupted in front.</p>
<p>Both the <i>Molpastes</i> and the <i>Otocompsa</i> bulbuls
build neat cup-shaped nests in trees and
shrubs in gardens. Not infrequently they
nest in plants growing in pots placed in the
verandah. (Illus. B. D., p. 296; also B. B.,
p. 87.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_22">22</a>. <i>Pycnonotus luteolus</i>: The White-browed Bulbul. (F. 305), (J. 452), (-II.)</p>
<p>A dull greenish brown bird, having no crest.
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
It has a white eyebrow, and the patch of
feathers under the tail is pale yellow.</p>
<p>It occurs only in Southern India and is exceedingly
common in the vicinity of Madras.
It frequents gardens and utters a variety of
very cheery little notes, and has, therefore, been
called &ldquo;the blithest little bird in existence.&rdquo;
It does not show itself very much in the open,
being heard much more frequently than seen.
It builds a cup-shaped nest in a bush or low
tree.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Nuthatches</i>, 23 <i>and</i> 24</h3>
<p>Nuthatches are little climbing birds characterised
by very short tails. They go about
in small flocks and run up and down the trunks
and branches of trees with great address,
picking up small insects. They also, as their
name implies, feed upon nuts. They nest in
holes of trees, frequently closing up a portion
of the aperture with mud. (Illus. F. I., p. 298.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_23">23</a>. <i>Sitta castaneiventris</i>: The Chestnut-bellied
Nuthatch. (F. 321), (J. 250), (-I.)</p>
<p>Upper plumage dark greyish blue. A broad
black band runs from the beak, through the
eye and down the side of the head. The other
parts of the cheek are white. The lower
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
plumage is dark chestnut-red, as denoted by
the popular name of the bird. (The lower
parts of the hen are of a lighter hue.) Distribution:
U. P., C. P., C. I., and western parts of
Bengal.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_24">24</a>. <i>Sitta frontalis</i>: The Velvet-fronted Blue
Nuthatch. (F. 325), (J. 253), (-I.)</p>
<p>Upper plumage dark blue, the cock having a
velvet-like black forehead and a black streak
through the eye; throat whitish; lower parts
greyish.</p>
<p>Not found in the Punjab.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Drongos</i>, 25-27</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_25">25</a>. <i>Dicrurus ater</i>: The Black Drongo, or
King Crow. (F. 327), (J. 278), (II, but with
a tail six inches long.)</p>
<p>Jet black all over, with a long-forked tail.
One of the most familiar of Indian birds. It
frequently perches on telegraph wires, or on
the backs of cattle. It makes little flights after
insects and then returns to its perch. Its call
is very cheery and is heard most often at
earliest dawn.</p>
<p>It breeds in the hot weather; the nest is a
small cup, wedged into the fork of a lofty
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
branch. The oriole and the dove frequently
nest in the same tree.</p>
<p>Found all over India, but only a summer
visitor to the Frontier Province and the
Western Punjab, and a winter visitor to
Assam. (Illus. B. D., frontispiece; also I. F.,
p. 148, and B. B., p. 1.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_26">26</a>. <i>Dicrurus c&aelig;rulescens</i>: The White-bellied
Drongo. (F. 330), (J. 281), (II, but with long-forked
tail.)</p>
<p>Very like the King Crow (No. 25) in appearance,
save that it is a little smaller and its
plumage is deep indigo instead of glossy black
(but it looks black from a distance). The
breast is grey and the abdomen white.</p>
<p>This bird, although nowhere common in
India, is found in all parts save the N.W.
F. P., the Punjab, and the eastern portion of
Bengal.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_27">27</a>. <i>Dissemurus paradiseus</i>: The Larger
Racket-tailed Drongo. (F. 340), (J. 284), (II,
but with a tail 20 inches long.)</p>
<p>Glossy black all over. The head is decorated
by a large backwardly-directed crest. The
two outer tail feathers are a foot and a half in
length; on the inner side of the shaft there is
scarcely any web, while the web on the outer
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
shaft grows longer as it nears the tip of the
feather. These elongated outer feathers are
turned upwards and outwards at the tip.</p>
<p>Confined almost entirely to forests, and hence is very rarely seen in the plains.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Warblers</i>, 28-33</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_28">28</a>. <i>Orthotomus sutorius</i>: The Indian Tailor
Bird. (F. 374), (J. 530), (-I.)</p>
<p>A tiny brownie bird not unlike a wren with
a respectable tail. Close inspection shows that
the forehead is reddish, the back of the head
grey, and the back brown, tinged with green.
The lower plumage is dirty creamy white.
There is a short black bar on each side of the
neck, visible only when the bird stretches its
neck to utter its note, but as the bird is continually
calling loudly <i>to-wee, to-wee, to-wee</i>, a
little watching will soon reveal the black
patch on the side of the neck.</p>
<p>In the hot weather the two middle tail
feathers of the cock exceed the others in
length by fully two inches. These projecting,
bristle-like tail feathers render it very easy to
recognise the cock tailor bird in breeding
plumage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The tailor bird is essentially a denizen of
the compound, and frequently nests in the
verandah. The nest is a wonderful structure.
The walls are growing leaves, the edges of
which the bird draws together by means of
cotton or fibre. The nest is cosily lined with
cotton-down. The tailor bird pierces in places
the leafy wall of its nest and pushes some of
the lining through these tiny apertures in order
to keep the lining <i>in situ</i>. The nest should be
looked for in the hot weather. (Illus. B. B.,
p. 103; also G. B., p. 64.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_29">29</a>. <i>Hypolais rama</i>: Sykes&rsquo;s Tree-warbler.
(F. 394), (J. 553), (-I.)</p>
<p>This, too, is a dull-coloured little brownie
bird. It visits India in great numbers in the
winter, and is said to breed in Sind. In
colouring it is much like the tailor bird, but it
is more solidly built and has a narrow cream-coloured
eyebrow. A little brown bird which
is not the tailor bird, or one of the wren-warblers
described below, is likely to be this
species.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_30">30</a>. <i>Prinia lepida</i>: The Streaked Wren-warbler.
(F. 462), (J. 550), (-I.)</p>
<p>Brown above and cream-coloured below.
This little bird is easily distinguished from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
other long-tailed wrens, by the fact that its
upper plumage is streaked with dark brown.
The brown tail shows cross bars. The tip of
each tail feather is white and next to this is
a black patch.</p>
<p>This bird is common in the Punjab and in
Sind. It also occurs in Rajputana and in the
valley of the Ganges.</p>
<p>It builds a neat ball-like nest with an entrance
at the side. The nest is usually situated at a
few inches from the ground. Several are to be
found in April and May amid the wild
indigo that grows on the Lahore golf links.
The green eggs have a distinct ring of reddish
dots at the thick end.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_31">31</a>. <i>Prinia socialis</i>: The Ashy Wren-warbler.
(F. 464), (J. 534), (-I.)</p>
<p>Another &ldquo;tiny brownie bird.&rdquo; Ashy upper
plumage with brown wings and tail, lower
plumage cream-coloured. A very slender and
loosely-knit bird. It is easily distinguished by
the curious snapping noise it makes as it flits
from bush to bush. How this noise is made
we do not know. It sounds as though it were
due to the upper and lower mandibles of the
beak closing sharply together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>This species constructs two types of nests&mdash;one
is like that of the Tailor Bird (No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_28">28</a>),
the other is a ball-like woven structure with
an entrance at the side. The nest is invariably
placed near the ground. The eggs are mahogany
red. Does not occur in the N.W. F. P.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_32">32</a>. <i>Prinia inornata</i>: The Indian Wren-warbler. This bird is known as the weaver-bird
to boys who attend Indian schools. (F. 466), (J. 543), (-I.)</p>
<p>This species differs so little in appearance
from the last that except for the snapping
noise it is almost impossible to distinguish
them unless held in the hand and compared.
This species has rusty-coloured thighs, and
these may serve to distinguish it from the last
species.</p>
<p>It builds a nicely-woven ball-like nest, which
is frequently attached to growing corn, and
the parent birds sometimes have their work
cut out in rearing up their brood before the
crop is cut. Eggs greenish with red and brown
blotches.</p>
<p>Found in N. India. At the Nilgiris this
species meets the next.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_33">33</a>. <i>Prinia Jerdoni</i>: The Southern Wren-warbler.
(F. 467), (J. 544), (-I.)</p>
<p>This is the South Indian form of No. 32,
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and has very much the same habits and appearance
as the last species. (Illus. B. B., p. 103.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Shrikes, or Butcher Birds</i>, 34-37</h3>
<p>The shrikes form a well-marked family of
birds. Their habit is to sit on an exposed
perch and from thence pounce on to some
insect on the ground. Thus their habits are
like those of some birds of prey. Their
hooked and notched beaks and the broad black
band that runs from the base of the beak
through the eye gives them a very sinister
appearance. They have a variety of notes.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_34">34</a>. <i>Lanius lahtora</i>: The Indian Grey Shrike.
(F. 469), (J. 256), (+II.)</p>
<p>Upper parts French grey; forehead black;
broad black band from base of beak, through
eye and down the side of the neck. Tail black
and white; wings black with conspicuous white
bar. Breast and lower plumage white.</p>
<p>Sind, Punjab, U. P., C. P., and Western
Bengal.</p>
<p>The nest of this and of the other species of
butcher bird is a deep cup, placed usually in a
thorny tree, often close up against the trunk.
Not infrequently bits of rag hang down from
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
the nest and serve to locate its whereabouts.
The eggs have a stone-coloured background
with brownish blotches, which often form a
ring near the large end. (Illus. B. B., p. 70;
also F. I., p. 454.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_35">35</a>. <i>Lanius vittatus</i>: The Bay-backed Shrike.
(F. 473), (J. 260), (-II.)</p>
<p>Forehead and broad band through the eye
black. Head pale grey, back maroon, rump
white; wings black with a white bar, which is
conspicuous during flight. Tail black and
white, median feathers black, outer ones white;
lower parts white with a reddish-yellow tinge
on the breast.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_36">36</a>. <i>Lanius erythronotus</i>: The Rufous-backed
Shrike. (F. 476), (J. 257), (+II.)</p>
<p>Although larger than the last species, this
bird is very like it in colouring. It may, however,
be distinguished by the fact that it has
no white in the tail. The rump is the same
colour as the lower back and not white as
in 35.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_37">37</a>. <i>Lanius cristatus</i>: The Brown Shrike.
(F. 481), (J. 261), (-II.)</p>
<p>This species is distinguishable from the above
three shrikes by the fact that it lacks the white
wing bar which makes the others so conspicuous
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
during flight. A reddish-brown bird with
white cheeks and throat and a whitish eyebrow.</p>
<p>Unlike the other butcher birds this species
is merely a winter visitor to India. It spreads
itself over all parts of the country save the
N.W. F. P. and the Punjab. (A few individuals
are said to remain in India to nest.)</p>
<p>It has a harsh chattering note, which it
utters incessantly. It is regarded in Calcutta
as the herald of the cold weather. (Illus. G. B.,
p. 16.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_38">38</a>. <i>Tephrodornis pondicerianus</i>: The Common Woodshrike. (F. 488), (J. 265), (+I.)</p>
<p>An ashy-brown bird, having a broad white
eyebrow and the outer tail feathers white.
Occurs chiefly in gardens and avenues. It is
most easily recognised by its pretty mellow
note, which Jesse syllabises as <i>tanti-tuia</i>.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Minivets</i>, 39-41</h3>
<p>Minivets are brightly coloured little birds,
which usually go about in small flocks, picking
insects from off the leaves of trees. They
build neat cup-shaped nests, which are usually
placed on a horizontal branch. The nest is
difficult to find, as when seen from below it
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
looks like a knot in the branch. The flocks lead
a wandering existence.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_39">39</a>. <i>Pericrocotus speciosus</i>: The Indian Scarlet
Minivet. (F. 490), (J. 271), (I, but with
tail of 4&frac12; inches long.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: A beautiful bird arrayed in bright
scarlet and black. The head and shoulders are
black, the back and lower parts scarlet. The
wings are black with a scarlet bar running
along (and not, as is usual, across) the wing.
Tail feathers scarlet except the median pair,
which are black.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Head and body bright yellow, wings
black with longitudinal yellow bar. Tail yellow
and black.</p>
<p>Occurs in U. P., Bengal, Assam, and C. P.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_40">40</a>. <i>Pericrocotus brevirostris</i>: The short-billed
Minivet. (F. 495), (J. 273), (-I, but
with tail 4 inches long.)</p>
<p>Very much like the Scarlet Minivet (39) in
appearance, save that the red of the cock is
crimson rather than scarlet.</p>
<p>Occurs in Punjab, Rajputana, U. P., Bengal, Assam and C. P. (Illus. G. B., p. 64.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_41">41</a>. <i>Pericrocotus peregrinus</i>: The Small Minivet. (F. 500), (J. 276), (-I, tail 3 inches long.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p><i>Cock</i>: Head and shoulders slaty grey, lower
back deep scarlet, wings black with red bar,
tail black with red at tip, chin and throat
blackish, breast scarlet; lower plumage orange-yellow.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Upper parts grey, lower parts creamy
white, wing brown with yellow or orange wing-bar,
tail black with red tip.</p>
<p>Not found in the N.W. F. P.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Cuckoo-Shrikes</i>, 42 <i>and</i> 43</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_42">42</a>. <i>Campophaga sykesi</i>: The Black-headed Cuckoo-Shrike. (F. 508), (J. 268), (-II.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: Head, throat, and breast black; rest of plumage grey shading into white on the
abdomen; tail black with broad white tip.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Upper parts grey, lower parts whitish with narrow black cross bars, tail as in cock.
This species goes about in small flocks, is strictly arboreal, and has many of the habits
of the minivets.</p>
<p>Not found in Punjab or N.W. F. P.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_43">43</a>. <i>Graucalus macii</i>: The Large Cuckoo-Shrike. (F. 510), (J. 270), (+III.)</p>
<p>A large pale slaty-grey bird with a black patch in front of the eye. The lower parts
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
are paler than the upper parts and often exhibit more or less distinct narrow black cross
bars; habits as above.</p>
<p>Found all over India, but rare in the N.W. portion of the peninsula.</p>
<p>Neither 42 or 43 are very common birds.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Orioles</i>, 44 <i>and</i> 45</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_44">44</a>. <i>Oriolus kundoo</i>: The Indian Oriole, or Mango Bird. (F. 518), (J. 470), (-III.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: A bright yellow bird with a pink
beak and red eyes. There is some black on the
sides of the head and in the wings and the tail.
During flight this bird looks like a flash of gold.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Of duller hue than the cock, with greenish back.</p>
<p>A strictly arboreal species. The note is a soft, rich, mellow <i>peeho, peeho</i>.</p>
<p>The nest is a wonderful structure&mdash;a large
cup slung like a hammock or prawn net on the
fork of a bow, usually placed in one of the
lower branches of a lofty tree, but out of
reach of a human being. This species very
frequently builds in the same tree as the King
Crow. The eggs are pale pink, with chocolate
blotches, which wash off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>This bird is not found in Eastern Bengal, or
in the eastern portion of Bengal proper. It is
found all the year round in most parts of India,
but is merely a summer visitor to the Punjab,
N.W. F. P., and the Himalayas.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_45">45</a>. <i>Oriolus melanocephalus</i>: The Black-headed Oriole. (F. 521), (J. 472 and 473), (-III.)</p>
<p>Very much like the last species, but is distinguishable by having the whole head, chin,
throat, and upper breast black.</p>
<p>Not found in the Punjab, or N.W. F. P., or
in the Himalayas. (Illus. G. B., p. 16; also I. F., p. 128.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Grackles, or Hill Mynas</i>, 46 <i>and</i> 47</h3>
<p>As these birds are almost exclusively confined to hilly and well-wooded regions they
can scarcely be numbered among the common birds of the plains of India; but as they are
so very frequently seen in cages, I mention them.</p>
<p>They are larger than the common myna, but have a much shorter tail. They are glossy black
birds with a conspicuous white wing bar. Beak orange-yellow, legs pale yellow. Their
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
most conspicuous feature is the pair of yellow wattles.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_46">46</a>. <i>Eulabes religiosa</i>: The Southern Grackle. (F. 523), (J. 692), (III.)</p>
<p>Found only in S. India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_47">47</a>. <i>Eulabes intermedia</i>: The Indian Grackle. (F. 524), (J. 693), (+III.)</p>
<p>Found in the Himalayas and C. P.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Starlings</i>, 48-54</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_48">48</a>. <i>Pastor roseus</i>: The Rose-coloured Starling, or Jowaree Bird, or Tilyer. (F. 528), (J. 690), (+III.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: Head, throat, wings, and tail glossy
black; rest of plumage rose-coloured pink.</p>
<p><i>Hens and young cocks</i>: In these the pink is
replaced by a pinkish grey, or pale coffee-coloured
hue. The great majority of birds
one sees in India are hens or young cocks. The
head is crested, but the black crest rests flat
on the head, so that it is not noticeable.</p>
<p>Rosy starlings do not breed in India, although
individuals may be seen in all months
of the year. The birds are most abundant in
the winter. Preparatory to leaving the country
for breeding purposes rosy starlings congregate
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
in huge flocks in April and May. These flocks
do much damage to the grain, and hence are
known as <i>Jowaree</i> and <i>Cholum</i> birds. They are
also very partial to mulberries, and are therefore
sometimes known as Mulberry birds. (B.
D., p. 86.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_49">49</a>. <i>Sturnus menzbieri</i>: The Common Indian Starling. (F. 532), (J. 681), (+II.)</p>
<p>Very like the common English starling in appearance. Glossy black with numbers of
small yellow or buff spots; in certain lights it shows a green or bronze sheen.</p>
<p>A winter visitor to Northern India. Abundant in the Punjab during the cold weather,
where it is usually seen in flocks.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_50">50</a>. <i>Sturnia malabarica</i>: The Grey-headed Myna. (F. 538), (J. 688), (II.)</p>
<p>Head pale grey, chin almost white, rest of upper plumage dark grey with a reddish tinge,
throat and breast reddish grey with a white shaft to each feather; remainder of lower
plumage rusty red. Beak greenish blue with yellow tip.</p>
<p>Not found in Sind, N.W. F. P., or the Punjab. In the other parts of India it undergoes
local migration. I have seen it in Madras only in the cold weather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>This is the most arboreal of the mynas, rarely if ever descending to the ground, and
frequenting the topmost branches of trees. It associates in small flocks. Its note is a harsh
chuckle.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_51">51</a>. <i>Temenuchus pagodarum</i>: The Black-headed or Brahminy Myna, or Pawai. (F. 544), (J. 687), (+II.)</p>
<p>Head, neck, and lower plumage rich buff; wings black and grey; tail feathers brown with
white tips; crest black. The long crest rests flat on the neck and looks like a pig-tail, having
a silky hair-like appearance. Beak blue with yellow tip. Legs bright yellow.</p>
<p>Like most other mynas this species nests in a hole. In this case the nest-hole is usually
in some building or tree. An unpleasant odour emanates from the nest.</p>
<p>This bird and No. 50 are very alike in shape and colouring, the most noticeable difference
being in the colour of the head and crest and of the legs.</p>
<p>Not found in Eastern Bengal, the N.W. F. P., or the western portion of the Punjab.
(Illus. B. D., p. 82; also B. B., p. 124.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_52">52</a>. <i>Acridotheres tristis</i>: The Common Myna. (F. 549), (J. 684), (III.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>One of the most familiar of our Indian birds. Head, neck, and upper breast black; rest of
body plumage rich brown; wings black, showing a very conspicuous white bar during flight.
Tail feathers black with broad white tips, visible during flight. Beak and legs bright
yellow; bright yellow patch of skin behind eye.</p>
<p>This bird is found in every garden in India. It feeds largely on the ground.</p>
<p>It is a noisy bird. Eha describes its notes as
&ldquo;<i>Keeky, keeky, keeky . . . churr, churr, kok,
kok, kok</i>. Each time it says <i>kok</i> it points to
the ground with its beak and bobs its head.&rdquo;
(Illus. B. D., p. 84; also F. I., p. 516, and
B. C., p. 44.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_53">53</a>. <i>Acridotheres ginginianus</i>: The Bank or Well Myna. (F. 551), (J. 685), (-III.)</p>
<p>Very like <a class="rb" href="#bird_51">51</a> in shape, but its prevailing tint is grey instead of brown. The wing bar and
the tips of the tail feathers are buff instead of white, and the patch of skin behind the eye is
crimson instead of yellow.</p>
<p>Not found in S. India.</p>
<p>It goes about in flocks and nests in holes in river banks or wells, hence its popular name.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_54">54</a>. <i>Sturnopastor contra.</i> The Pied Myna. (F. 555), (J. 683), (-III.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>A black bird, white cheeks and rump, and
white bar at base of wing; lower parts grey.
Beak orange with white tip; orange patch of
skin behind the eye.</p>
<p>This bird differs from the other mynas in
that it builds a large nest in a tree, usually at
no great altitude.</p>
<p>Occurs only in U. P., C. P., the Bengals, and
Assam. (Illus. G. B., p. 16.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Flycatchers</i>, 55-60</h3>
<p>Flycatchers are birds which feed exclusively
on insects, which they catch upon the wing.
Their habit is to make, from some perch, little
sallies into the air after their quarry. It must,
however, not be forgotten that birds other
than flycatchers, as, for example, the king
crow and the wagtails, also hunt for insects in
this manner; so that it is not safe to set down
a bird as a flycatcher merely because it makes
little sallies into the air after insect quarry.</p>
<p>A considerable number of species of flycatcher
occur in India, but the great majority
of them are confined to the hills. The following,
however, are likely to be seen in the plains,
Nos. 57-60 being especially abundant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_55">55</a>. <i>Alseonax latirostris.</i> The Brown Flycatcher.
(F. 588), (J. 297), (-I.)</p>
<p>An ashy-brown bird; tail darker than body,
lower parts white, inconspicuous ring of white
feathers round the eye. Not a very common
bird.</p>
<p>Not found in N.W. F. P., Punjab, Sind, or
Rajputana.</p>
<p>A little brown bird with a short tail, that
makes a sally into the air after an insect, and
then returns to its perch, is probably this species.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_56">56</a>. <i>Culicicapa ceylonensis</i>: The Grey-headed
Flycatcher. (F. 592), (J. 295), (-I.)</p>
<p>Head, neck, and breast ash-coloured. Back
greenish yellow; wings and tail dark brown.
Lower plumage dull yellow.</p>
<p>A winter visitor to the plains. Not likely to
be seen in N.W. India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_57">57</a>. <i>Terspiphone paradisi</i>: The Indian Paradise
Flycatcher, also known as the Ribbon Bird
and the Widow Bird. (F. 598), (J. 288), (II,
but the cock has a very long tail.)</p>
<p>One of the most beautiful birds in India.</p>
<p><i>Hen and young cock</i>: Like a bulbul in size
and form. Rich chestnut plumage with
metallic black crest and head; lower parts
white. Bill bluish black. Legs slate-coloured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p><i>Second year cock</i>: Similar to above, except
that the two median tail feathers are much
longer than the others, being 16 inches in
length.</p>
<p><i>Old cocks</i>: The chestnut parts of the plumage
turn white.</p>
<p>This bird undergoes a certain amount of
local migration. It visits the Punjab in great
numbers in summer for nesting purposes. The
nest is like an inverted cone in shape, and is
usually placed on one of the lower branches of
a tree. The white cock shares the duties of
incubation, and as he sits, his long white tail
feathers hang down several inches beyond the
bottom of the nest.</p>
<p>The bird frequently utters a sharp note
something like the twitter of a sparrow. The
cock has also a sweet little song.</p>
<p>In Burma this species is replaced by an
allied species&mdash;the Burmese Paradise Flycatcher
(<i>T. affinis</i>). (Illus. F. II., p. 1; also
B. B., p. 76, and G. B. frontispiece.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Fantail Flycatchers</i>, 58-60</h3>
<p>These are blackish-brown birds, with a conspicuous
white eyebrow. There are some
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
white spots in the wing. The tail feathers are
tipped with white, and as the bird continually
spreads its tail into a fan the white is very
conspicuous. The lower plumage is white.
These birds have a striking and very cheery
song of about six notes, which they utter
constantly. They are easily recognised by
their &ldquo;tinkling&rdquo; song and by the manner in
which they continually fan the tail, drop the
wings, and dance; or, to use Eha&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;waltz and pirouette among the lower
branches of a shady mango tree.&rdquo; Three species
are common, and have similar manners and
appearance. The nest is either a neat cup
or an inverted cone, built largely of cobweb
on one of the lower branches of a tree. When
they have a nest these flycatchers are very
bold. They will set upon and drive away
birds much larger than themselves, and will
even offer to attack an intruding human being.
The three species are distinguished as follows:</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_58">58</a>. <i>Rhipidura albifrontata</i>: The white-browed
Fantail Flycatcher. (F. 604), (J. 292), (+I.)</p>
<p>Distinguished by its very broad white eyebrow and forehead. The common species of
N. India. Nest a cup.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>

<h3 class="genus"><i>The Robins</i>, 61-69</h3>
<p>61 and 62. <i>The Pied Bush Chats.</i></p>
<p>The <i>cock</i> is a black bird (brownish in early
winter), with a conspicuous white wing patch
and a white rump.</p>
<p>The <i>hen</i> is a reddish-brown bird (greyish in
winter), with a black tail with a reddish patch
over the tail. The hen may be distinguished
from other brownish birds by the peculiar
colouring of her mate.</p>
<p>The nest is in a hole in the ground at the
base of a tussock of long grass.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_61">61</a>. <i>Pratincola caprata</i>: The Common Pied
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Bush Chat, or White-winged Black Robin.
(F. 608), (J. 481), (-I.)</p>
<p>Found in N. and C. India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_62">62</a>. <i>Pratincola atrata</i>: The Southern Pied
Bush Chat. (F. 609), (J. 482), (I.)</p>
<p>Found in S. India.</p>
<p>The above two species may perhaps be regarded
as local varieties.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_63">63</a>. <i>Pratincola maura</i>: The Indian Bush
Chat. (F. 610), (J. 483), (-I.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: The upper parts are reddish brown
in winter (black in summer owing to the brown
edges to the feathers being worn away). Large
patch of white on each side of neck; breast
orange-red, lower parts pale reddish brown.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Reddish brown all over; no white
neck patch.</p>
<p>A winter visitor to all parts of Northern
India; occurs usually in open fields.</p>
<p>The hens of these species of robin-like birds
are very difficult to distinguish; but as they
are usually found in company with the cock
it is not as a rule difficult to assign them to
their proper species.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_64">64</a>. <i>Cercomela fusca</i>: The Brown Rock
Chat&mdash;the <i>Desi shama</i> of Indians. (F. 629),
(J. 494), (+I.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>A dull inconspicuous brown bird. It frequents
buildings and is robin-like in its habits.
As it hops about it continually bobs its head.
The cock sings a sweet little lay. The nest is
made up of dried grass and placed in a niche
or on a ledge in an outhouse, or a mosque, or
even an inhabited room. It is made of dried
grass and roots, and falls to pieces if lifted
from its foundation. The eggs are pale blue
blotched with reddish yellow.</p>
<p>Found in Punjab, Rajputana, U. P., and
C. P.; very common at Lahore.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_65">65</a>. <i>Ruticilla rufiventris</i>: The Indian Redstart.
(F. 644), (J. 497), (I.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: Each feather of the head, breast, and
upper plumage is black, fringed with grey, so
that after the autumn moult the cock is dark
grey in these parts; but gradually the grey
edges wear away, so that by the spring the
head, neck, and upper parts of the cock look
black. The rump and the feathers over the tail
are reddish chestnut. The abdomen is orange-red.
All the feathers of the tail are reddish except
the two median ones, which are brown.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Reddish brown when the cock is
grey or black; otherwise like the cock, except
that the red in her plumage is duller.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>The redstart is an easy bird to identify, it
behaves as though it had St. Vitus&rsquo; dance in the
tail. As it flies away all the red in its plumage
shows, so that the bird looks like a ball of
fire. It feeds largely on the ground, taking
cover in bushes when alarmed. It frequents
gardens.</p>
<p>A winter visitor to India. Very common in
the north and rarer in the south.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_66">66</a>. <i>Thamnobia cambaiensis</i>: The Brown-backed
Indian Robin. (F. 661), (J. 480), (+I.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: A glossy black bird with a brown
back, a narrow white bar in the wing, and a
conspicuous patch of brick-red under the tail.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: A sandy brown bird with a brick-red
patch under the tail.</p>
<p>A familiar bird which haunts gardens and is
very partial to dry sandy localities. It builds a
neat cup-shaped nest on window-ledges or in
holes in walls, banks, etc. It usually carries
the tail raised almost vertically and so displays
the red patch. Occurs all over Northern
India. South of the Godaveri it is replaced
by <a class="rb" href="#bird_67">67</a>.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_67">67</a>. <i>Thamnobia fulicata</i>: The Black-backed
Indian Robin. (F. 662), (J. 479), (+I.)</p>
<p>The hen of this species is scarcely distinguishable
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
from the hen of <i>T. cambaiensis</i> (66). The cock differs in having the back black instead
of brown. Occurs only in S. India. (Illus. B. D., p. 294.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_68">68</a>. <i>Copsychus saularis</i>: The Magpie Robin,
or Dayal. (F. 663), (J. 475), (-II.)</p>
<p>A very familiar garden bird.</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: A glossy black bird, with a white
abdomen sharply marked off from the black
throat and breast. Outer tail feathers white.
A conspicuous white wing bar.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Marked like the cock, but greyish
brown where he is black. This species, like
the last, frequently elevates the tail.</p>
<p>The cock has a fine song in spring. This
and the magpie pattern of its plumage cause
it to be readily identified. The cock and hen
pair for life. They frequent gardens and are
robin-like in habits. It nests in holes in trees
or buildings. The nest is frequently found in
stables and outhouses. (Illus. F. II., p. 56;
also G. B., frontispiece, and B. B., p. 97.)</p>

<p><i>Cock</i>: Upper plumage glossy black. Lower
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
back white. Wings black and white. Lower
plumage chestnut red.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Like the cock, save that the black is
replaced by slaty brown and the reddish lower
parts are much paler than in the cock.</p>
<p>Found only in thick jungle. (Illus. G. B.,
p. 40.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Weaver Birds</i>, 70-73</h3>
<p>Weaver birds are sparrow-like birds of
gregarious habits. They build, or rather
weave, wonderful flask-shaped or retort-shaped
nests which hang from trees, the entrance
being from below. They breed in the rains.
Four species are found in India, these are:</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_70">70</a>. <i>Ploceus baya</i>: The Baya, or Common
Weaver Bird, or Bottle Bird. (F. 720), (J. 694),
(I.)</p>
<p>At most seasons of the year the cock and
hen are reddish-brown birds with a faint, fawn-coloured
eyebrow, and look very like the hen
house sparrow, having, like her, a thick bill.
The hen baya retains this plumage throughout
the year. In the hot weather, however, the
head and neck of the cock become a beautiful
golden yellow, as does the breast, and the chin
turns almost black. In this plumage the cock
baya is very easily recognised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>This species occurs in all parts of India
except Bengal, Assam, and Burma. In these
places it is replaced by an allied species (<a class="rb" href="#bird_71">71</a>).
(Illus. F. II., p. 173; also B. B., p. 131.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_71">71</a>. <i>Ploceus megarhynchus</i>: The Eastern
Baya. (F. 721), (J. 694), (I.)</p>
<p>This species differs so little from (No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_70">70</a>)
<i>P. baya</i>, that I am inclined to regard it as a
local race of the latter species.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_72">72</a>. <i>Ploceus bengalensis</i>: The Black-throated
Weaver-bird. (F. 722), (J. 696), (-I.)</p>
<p>This species is very like <a class="rb" href="#bird_70">70</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_71">71</a> in appearance,
but may be distinguished by (1) a yellow
patch on the side of the neck, (2) the black
breast, (3) by the fact that the tubular entrance
to the nest is short and not long like that of
<i>P. baya</i> and <i>P. megarhynchus</i>.</p>
<p>This is a comparatively rare species and is
not found in S. India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_73">73</a>. <i>Ploceus manyar</i>: The Striated Weaver-bird.
(F. 723), (J. 695), (I.)</p>
<p>This species is distinguishable from Nos. <a class="rb" href="#bird_70">70</a>,
<a class="rb" href="#bird_71">71</a>, and <a class="rb" href="#bird_72">72</a>, by having the feathers of the
breast streaked longitudinally with black.</p>
<p>It is found all over India, but is not nearly
so commonly seen as <i>P. baya</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Munias</i>, 74-79</h3>
<p>Munias are diminutive birds, considerably
smaller than the sparrow, characterised by
very thick bills. Except when breeding they
usually go about in flocks. The nest, which
is rarely situated at any great distance from
the ground, is a large, ball-like structure,
having an entrance at the side. The eggs are
white.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_74">74</a>. <i>Munia malacca</i>: The Black-headed
Munia. (F. 725), (J. 697), (-I.)</p>
<p>Head and breast black, back wings and tail
rich chestnut, tinged with maroon. Abdomen
white, rest of lower plumage black. Bill very
pale slate colour.</p>
<p>This handsome species is confined to S.
India; in the north it is replaced by a closely
allied species (<a class="rb" href="#bird_75">75</a>).</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_75">75</a>. <i>Munia atricapilla</i>: The Chestnut-bellied
Munia. (F. 726), (J. 698), (-I.)</p>
<p>This differs from <a class="rb" href="#bird_74">74</a> only in having the
abdomen chestnut instead of white.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_76">76</a>. <i>Uroloncha malabarica</i>: The White-throated
Munia (called the <i>Chiruka</i> in N.
India). (F. 734), (J. 703), (-I.)</p>
<p>Jerdon&rsquo;s name for this bird&mdash;the Plain
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Brown Munia&mdash;is much more appropriate than
that given it by Oates, for the white of the
throat is rarely, if ever, pure, being usually
cream-coloured.</p>
<p>This is the species of munia most commonly
seen, and is found in all parts of the plains of
India, save Eastern Bengal and Burma.</p>
<p>It is a plainly-coloured bird, the upper
plumage being earthy brown save for a white
patch on the rump. The lower plumage is
dirty white. It has a twittering, sparrow-like
note, syllabised by Sykes as &ldquo;<i>cheet, cheet,
cheet</i>.&rdquo; The feathers of the tail are graduated.
This, the small size of the bird, the white patch
on the rump, the thick bill, and the note
should serve to enable the observer to identify
this inconspicuous little munia. (Illus. B. B.,
p. 137.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_77">77</a>. <i>Uroloncha punctulata</i>: The Spotted
Munia. (F. 735), (J. 699), (-I.)</p>
<p>This is known by bird fanciers as the Nutmeg
Bird and the Spice Bird. It, like No. 79, is one
of the common cage birds of India.</p>
<p>Head, neck, upper plumage, wings, and
tail are rich chocolate brown, that of the head
being darkest. The lower breast and abdomen
are white, but most of the feathers have each
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
a narrow black semicircular bar, so that the
lower parts of the bird have the appearance of
a nutmeg-grater: hence one of the popular
names of the bird. Bill dark slaty blue.</p>
<p>Does not occur in N.W. F. P. or Sind.
(Illus. G. B., p. 16.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_78">78</a>. <i>Stictospiza formosa</i>: The Green Munia,
or Green Waxbill. (F. 737), (J. 705), (-I.)</p>
<p>This beautiful little bird, which is barely
two-thirds the size of the sparrow, is frequently
caged. The upper plumage and
wings are light green, brighter in the cock
than in the hen; the tail is black, the lower
parts are yellow, brighter in the cock than in
the hen. Bill bright red.</p>
<p>Distribution: Central India and Southern
Bengal.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_79">79</a>. <i>Spor&aelig;ginthus amandava</i>: The Indian
Red Munia, or Red Waxbill, or Lal, or Amadavat.
(F. 738), (J. 704), (-I.)</p>
<p>Every aviary in India boasts one or two
amadavats.</p>
<p>This is a tiny little bird with a bright red
beak and red eyes. The general hue of the
plumage is reddish brown with patches of the
richest crimson and some tiny white spots.
There is more crimson in the cock than in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
hen, and in the former in the breeding season
than at other times of the year. But in both
sexes there is always a patch of crimson on the
lower rump. In full dress the cock has the
whole head, upper plumage, breast, and sides
of the body crimson. As, however, the wing
feathers are brown, the little birds look brown,
and not crimson, during flight. In order to
perceive the crimson they must be watched
when at rest in the sunlight.</p>
<p>They are highly gregarious and are found all
over India. In Burma this bird is replaced by
an allied one (<i>S. flavidiventris</i>), having the
abdomen yellowish red instead of black.
(Illus. G. B., frontispiece.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Finches</i>, 80-82</h3>
<p>These are seed-eating birds, characterised
by a thick, stout bill. The canary and the
house sparrow are the most familiar examples
of this family.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_80">80</a>. <i>Carpodacus erythninus</i>: The Common
Rose-Finch. (F. 761), (J. 738), (+I.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: A crimson bird, with brownish-green
wings. The crimson is bright on the breast,
throat, and rump. There are two yellowish-brown
bars on the wing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p><i>Hen</i>: A greenish-brown sparrow-like bird
with two conspicuous whitish bars on the
wing.</p>
<p>This bird is a winter visitor to the plains of
Northern and Central India, and, to some
extent, S. India. Natives call it the <i>Tuti</i>. It
has a pleasing song, but is not a bird that
obtrudes itself on the observer. Unless carefully
watched for it is apt to be overlooked.</p>
<p>Jerdon writes of this species, &ldquo;It visits the
plains during October, and leaves in April.
In March many are taken in fine breeding
livery. In the extreme south I have chiefly
seen it in bamboo jungle, feeding on the seeds
of bamboos on several occasions, and so much
is this its habit that the Telegu name signifies
&lsquo;Bamboo sparrow.&rsquo; In other parts of the
country it frequents alike groves, gardens, and
jungle, feeding on various seeds and grain;
also not infrequently on flower buds and young
leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eha does not include this species in his
<i>Common Birds of Bombay</i>. Cunningham says
it is fairly common in the gardens of Calcutta
during the winter months. Jesse states that
it is fairly common at Lucknow. At Lahore
I observed it only in March and April.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_81">81</a>. <i>Gymnorhis flavicollis</i>: The Yellow-throated
Sparrow. (F. 775), (J. 711), (I.)</p>
<p>A near relative of the common house
sparrow. In appearance it is like a particularly
tidy and slenderly built hen sparrow.
It may be readily distinguished by its having
a pale yellow patch on the throat, bright in the
cock and dull in the hen.</p>
<p>This species frequents gardens, but is far
less familiar in its behaviour than <i>Passer
domesticus</i>. It nests in holes, usually in trees.</p>
<p>Not found so far east as Calcutta. In the
Punjab it is a summer visitor, whither it
repairs for breeding purposes.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_82">82</a>. <i>Passer domesticus</i>: The Common Sparrow
or House Sparrow. (F. 776), (J. 706), (I.)</p>
<p>Description of this familiar and ubiquitous
bird is quite superfluous. I give it merely for
the sake of completeness.</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: Top of head and lower back ashy
grey, throat black, cheeks and sides of neck
pure white, streak over the eye and upper back
chestnut, wings and tail brown, the former with
a white bar; lower plumage dirty white.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: A dull brown bird with dirty white
under parts; reddish-white eyebrow and
white wing bar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Buntings</i>, 83-85</h3>
<p>The yellow-hammer, with its song of &ldquo;A
little bit of bread and <i>no</i> che-e-e-ese,&rdquo; has
rendered the bunting clan familiar to every
Englishman. Buntings are finch-like birds
with conical bills, mostly rather larger than
the sparrow.</p>
<p>Several species visit the plains of India in
large numbers every cold weather and wax
fat on the grain crops. They occur in large
noisy flocks, making merry among the various
cereal crops and taking refuge in trees when
disturbed. The species most commonly seen
are <i>E. buchanani</i>, <i>E. melanocephala</i>, and <i>E.
luteola</i>.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_83">83</a>. <i>Emberiza buchanani</i>: The Grey-necked Bunting. (F. 795), (J. 716), (+I.)</p>
<p>There is nothing striking in the appearance
of this bird. The upper plumage is ashy
brown, the shaft of each feather being darker
than the web, giving the bird a streaked
appearance. The lower parts are reddish
brown. There is some white in the tail
visible only during flight. There is an inconspicuous
white ring round the eye.</p>
<p>This occurs only in the N.W. parts of India.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_84">84</a>. <i>Emberiza melanocephala</i>: The Black-headed Bunting. (F. 799), (J. 721), (+I.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: The feathers of the head are black
with a grey border, so that the head looks grey
when the bird first reaches India in the
autumn, but gets blacker as the grey edges of
the feathers become worn away. The back
and shoulders are rich chestnut, the wings and
tail are brown, the cheeks and lower plumage
are deep bright yellow.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: A brownish bird with dull yellow
breast and abdomen and a bright yellow patch
under the tail. This species looks rather like a
large long-tailed weaver-bird.</p>
<p>Found in winter, and only in N.W. F. P.,
Punjab, C. P., and Bombay. It is the species
of bunting most abundant in the neighbourhood
of Bombay, where, as Eha says, it &ldquo;about
takes the place in India of the yellow-hammer
at home, swarming about fields and hedges
and singing with more cheer than music.&rdquo;
(Illus. B. B., p. 142.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_85">85</a>. <i>Emberiza luteola</i>: The Red-headed Bunting. (F. 800), (J. 722), (+I.)</p>
<p>A greenish-brown bird, with the head in the
cock a colour between that of chestnut and old

bright in male and duller in female.</p>
<p>Winter visitor to N.W. and Central India.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N.B.&mdash;None of the above buntings occur in Madras.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Swallows</i>, 86-90</h3>
<p>Swallows and martins form a well-marked
and familiar group of birds. The only other
family with which it is possible to confound
them is that of the swifts. Anatomically the
two families are far removed from one another;
but similarity of profession has brought about
similarity in outward appearance. Nevertheless,
the representatives of the two families
may be distinguished at a glance as they dash
through the air. &ldquo;As a swallow darts along,&rdquo;
writes Eha, &ldquo;its wings almost close against its
sides at every stroke, and it looks like a pair of
scissors opening and shutting. Now a swift
never closes its wings in this way. It whips
the air rapidly with the points of them, but
they are always extended and evenly curved
from tip to tip, like a bow, the slim body of
the bird being the arrow.&rdquo; Jefferies likens
a flying swift to an anchor with enormous
flukes. Another difference between the swifts
and the swallows is that the former never
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
perch on trees or wires or on the ground,
while the latter habitually seat themselves on
branches of trees and telegraph wires.</p>
<p>A small bird that dashes with great speed
through the air, frequently changing its course,
flying now high up, now just skimming the
ground, and seeming never to tire, can be nothing
other than a swift or a swallow. By the
tests given above it is easy to determine
whether any particular bird is a swift or a
swallow, but having got thus far it is a
matter of greater difficulty to determine the
species. (Illus. F. II., p. 267; also B. B., p. 35.)</p>
<p>Twenty-two species of swallow are found
in India; of these the following are most
commonly seen:</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_86">86</a>. <i>Cotile sinensis</i>: The Indian Sand-martin. (F. 809), (J. 88), (-I.)</p>
<p>A tiny swallow, only about two-thirds the
size of the sparrow. Upper plumage greyish
brown. Chin and breast greyish white, rest of
lower plumage white.</p>
<p>It nests in sandbanks, frequently in company.</p>
<p>Occurs only in N. India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_87">87</a>. <i>Ptyonoprogne concolor</i>: The Dusky Crag-martin. (F. 811), (J. 90), (-I.)</p>
<p>Upper plumage dark brown. Some white
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
spots on the tail. Lower plumage dark brown,
paler on the breast. The most dull-coloured
of the swallows. It builds a nest like that of
the common martin&mdash;a saucer of mud stuck
on to some vertical surface, usually a cliff or
the wall of a cave.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_88">88</a>. <i>Hirundo rustica</i>: The Common Swallow
(F. 813), (J. 82), (I, but with a deeply forked
tail 4&frac12; inches in length.)</p>
<p>Upper plumage glossy steel blue, wings and
tail black; some white in tail. Lower plumage
reddish yellow; forehead, chin, and throat
chestnut red.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_89">89</a>. <i>Hirundo smithii</i>: The Wire-tailed
Swallow. (F. 818), (J. 84), (-I, with the
two outer feathers of the tail, the ends of
which look like wires, 7 inches in length.)</p>
<p>Head chestnut, upper plumage glossy steel
blue, lower plumage pure white.</p>
<p>Not found in Madras or east of the U. P.
Builds cup-shaped nest of mud, usually under
a bridge or culvert; sometimes in a verandah.
Eggs white with small red splashes.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_90">90</a>. <i>Hirundo erythropygia</i>: Sykes&rsquo;s Striated Swallow, or the

in length.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Upper parts glossy steel blue, except for the sides of the head and the lower back; which are

<h3 class="genus"><i>The Wagtails</i>, 91-94</h3>
<p>This family includes the wagtails and pipits.
These are slenderly built birds, whose line of
flight is an undulating curve. They feed on
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
the ground, sometimes making little sallies into
the air after their quarry, and run with great
speed. They never hop. They constantly
&ldquo;wag the tail,&rdquo; hence their popular name.
The wagtails are distinguished from the pipits
by their brighter colouring and longer tails.
Pipits are earth-coloured birds with dark stripes
along the vein of each feather.</p>
<p>All the wagtails except <i>M. maderaspatensis</i>
are merely winter visitors to the plains of
India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_91">91</a>. <i>Motacilla alba</i>: The White Wagtail. (F. 826), (J. 591), (-II.)</p>
<p>General colour of plumage grey. Face, chin,
and throat white, back of head and nape
black; a black patch on the breast, the remainder
of the lower plumage is white. The
wings are black with much white in them.
The middle tail feathers are black, the outer
ones white. [In all wagtails the outer tail
feathers are white, and show up very distinctly
during flight.]</p>
<p>Not found in S. India. (Illus. B. B., p. 111.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_92">92</a>. <i>Motacilla maderaspatensis</i>: The Large
Pied Wagtail. (F. 831), (J. 589), (II.)</p>
<p>A black bird with a conspicuous white eyebrow.
The breast and lower plumage are
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
white. There is a broad white bar in the wing.
The outer tail feathers are white.</p>
<p>The only bird with which this wagtail can possibly be confounded is the cock magpie-robin
or <i>Dhayal</i> (<a class="rb" href="#bird_68">68</a>) (q.v.), but the two are easily distinguishable by&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The magpie-robin lacks the white eyebrows.</p>
<p>(2) The magpie-robin carries his tail erect; the wagtail never erects its tail.</p>
<p>Not found in Eastern Bengal, Assam, or Burma. A permanent resident. Nests in a
hole in an old boat, a roof, a bridge, etc. The eggs are greenish white, blotched with brown.</p>
<p>This wagtail is a fine songster, and may
sometimes be seen sitting on a telegraph wire
pouring forth its melody. (Illus. B. D., p. 14.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_93">93</a>. <i>Motacilla melanope</i>: The Grey Wagtail.
(F. 832), (J. 592), (-II.)</p>
<p>This bird is misnamed. It has a large amount
of yellow in its plumage. For this reason
Jerdon calls it the grey and yellow wagtail.</p>
<p>The upper parts are bluish grey, marked
with yellowish green on the lower back.
Throat white, lower plumage bright yellow,
wings brown, middle tail feathers black, outer
ones white.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_94">94</a>. <i>Motacilla borealis</i>: The Grey-headed
Wagtail. (F. 833), (J. 593), (-II.)</p>
<p>This species is so like <i>M. melanope</i> (No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_93">93</a>)
that it is not easy to differentiate between
them. It is, however, generally possible to
distinguish them by the fact that in this species
the chin is yellow, and the breast is sometimes
mottled with black.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Pipits</i>, 95 <i>and</i> 96</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_95">95</a>. <i>Anthus maculatus</i>: The Indian Tree-Pipit. (F. 841), (J. 596), (I.)</p>
<p>A dull-coloured bird like a wagtail in shape, but with a shorter tail, which it sometimes
wags in a half-hearted manner.</p>
<p>The upper parts are earthy brown with dark streaks. The lower parts are creamy white
with black streaks. There is a little white in the tail, visible only during flight. It feeds
on the ground, but takes refuge in a tree when disturbed. It frequently goes about in flocks.
There is nothing striking in its appearance or habits, and so it is not easy to describe satisfactorily.</p>
<p>A winter visitor. Not found in Madras. (Illus. B. B., p. 111).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_96">96</a>. <i>Anthus rufulus</i>: The Indian Pipit, or the Indian Tit-Lark. (F. 847), (J. 600), (I.)</p>
<p>This is scarcely distinguishable from the last
species (<a class="rb" href="#bird_95">95</a>). It has a somewhat longer bill and
longer legs. The claw of its hind toe is much
longer than that of <i>A. maculatus</i>, but this
cannot be seen unless the bird be held in the
hand. This species is found all over India.
Thus in N. India in winter a bird answering to
this description may be either species, and it
is only safe to set it down as a &ldquo;pipit.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Larks</i>, 97-103</h3>
<p>Larks are so like pipits that it is not easy to
distinguish between them without capturing
them. (Illus. F. II., p. 315.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_97">97</a>. <i>Alauda gulgula</i>: The Indian Skylark.
(F. 861), (J. 767), (+I.)</p>
<p>This is very like the above two pipits in
appearance, but there is a good deal more
white in the tail. Except for its somewhat
smaller size it is indistinguishable from the
English skylark, and all books on Indian ornithology
state that this bird soars up into the
heavens and pours forth its song just as the
lark does in England. I must confess that this
is not my experience. I have never seen this
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
species soar in the middle of the day, or at any
time save the very early morning.</p>
<p>This is a permanent resident and builds a nest
on the ground like that of the common skylark.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_98">98</a>. <i>Alaudula raytal</i>: The Ganges Sand-lark. (F. 866), (J. 762), (-I.)</p>
<p>This is distinguishable from the skylark by
its smaller size and its white under plumage.</p>
<p>It is a permanent resident, but is confined
to the sandy beds of the rivers of N. India. It
runs about near the edge of the water.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Bush Larks</i>, 99 <i>and</i> 100</h3>
<p>These are distinguished by having no white in the tail. They frequently perch in bushes
or low trees, whence they sometimes take short flights in the air.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_99">99</a>. <i>Mirafra assamica</i>: The Bengal Bush-lark.
(F. 870), (J. 754), (I.)</p>
<p>Found in U. P., Bengal, and Assam.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The common Bush Lark of the U.P. is not the Bengal
but the Red-winged Bush Lark (<i>Mirafra erythroptera</i>)
(F. 871) (J. 756) (-I). This is smaller than the Bengal
species and the brown of its upper plumage is tinged with red.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_100">100</a>. <i>Mirafra affinis</i>: The Madras Bush-lark. (F. 872), (J. 755), (I.)</p>
<p>Found in S. India. It is common in Guindy Park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Crested Larks</i>, 101-103</h3>
<p>These are readily distinguished by the sharp-pointed
crest which projects backwards and
upwards from the back of the head. They
sing well and have habits very similar to those
of the skylark. No white in the tail.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_101">101</a>. <i>Galerita cristata</i>: The Crested Lark. (F. 874), (J. 769), (+I.)</p>
<p>Punjab and U. P., where it is abundant. Very common at Lahore.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_102">102</a>. <i>Galerita deva</i>: Sykes&rsquo;s Crested Lark. (F. 875), (J. 765), (I.)</p>
<p>U. P., Rajputana, and C. I.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_103">103</a>. <i>Galerita malabarica</i>: The Malabar Crested Lark. (F. 876), (J. 768), (+I.)</p>
<p>Bombay and Travancore.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Finch-Larks</i>, 104 <i>and</i> 105</h3>
<p>These are easily recognised by their curious
habit of flying some twenty or thirty feet into
the air, then closing their wings and dropping
to the ground. As they descend they utter a
curious note. They are dumpy little birds
and do not look as large as their measurements.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_104">104</a>. <i>Ammomanes ph&oelig;nicura</i>: The Rufous-tailed
Finch-Lark. (F. 877), (J. 758), (I.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>A dark brown bird, with dark red on the
lower back and tail.</p>
<p>It is found chiefly in Central India in Bombay.
In Sind and the Punjab it is replaced by
<i>A. ph&oelig;nicuroides</i> (the Desert Finch-Lark).
Not found in Madras.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_105">105</a>. <i>Pyrrhulauda grisea</i>: The Ashy-crowned
Finch-Lark. (F. 879), (J. 760), (-I.)</p>
<p>This is the common Finch-Lark of India,
being a permanent resident everywhere, except
the N.W. F. P., Eastern Bengal, Assam, and
Burma.</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: Upper parts dark ashy grey. Streak
through the eye and all the lower plumage
black, cheeks and sides of breast white, so that,
as Eha points out, the black on the throat takes
the form of a cross. [This very unusual colouring,
i.e. darker below than above, renders the
cock easy to identify.]</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: The parts that are black in the cock
are reddish brown. (Illus. B. B., p. 142.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Sunbirds, or Honeysuckers</i>, 106-108</h3>
<p>These charming little birds are easy to
identify. They are the Old World counterparts
of the humming birds of the New World.
The hens are inconspicuous little brown birds
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
with yellow under parts, but the cocks wear a
gay livery. They build large hanging nests,
composed of dried grass, leaves, etc., held
together by cobweb, so that they look, from a
little distance, like hanging masses of rubbish.
Close inspection shows that the nest is pear-shaped,
with a circular entrance at one side
and a little porch over the entrance. The
nests are found in gardens, being sometimes
suspended from the roof of the verandah.</p>
<p>These birds feed largely on the nectar of
flowers, which they abstract by means of their
long tubular tongues. In order to obtain the
honey they frequently hover on rapidly-vibrating
wings, like humming birds.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_106">106</a>. <i>Arachnechthra lotenia</i>: Loten&rsquo;s Sunbird.
(F. 894), (J. 235), (-I.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: The whole plumage is dark metallic
purple, looking black in some lights, but in the
sun&rsquo;s rays it displays a green or lilac sheen. The
beak is long and curved.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Upper plumage earthy brown, lower
plumage very pale yellow.</p>
<p>Found only in S. India. Very common in
Madras. (Illus. B. P., pp. 78, 82, and 90.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_107">107</a>. <i>Arachnechthra asiatica</i>: The Purple
Sunbird. (F. 895), (J. 234), (-I.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p><i>Cock</i>: Very like <i>A. lotenia</i>, but this species
is smaller and its curved beak is shorter. It is a
very fine songster, its voice being as sweet as
that of the canary or the pied wagtail.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Upper plumage earthy brown, lower
plumage yellow.</p>
<p>Found all over India, but is only a summer
visitor to the Punjab and N.W. F. P. (Illus.
I. F., frontispiece.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_108">108</a>. <i>Arachnechthra zeylonica</i>: The Purple-rumped
Sunbird (F. 901), (J. 232), (-I.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: From a little distance the cock looks
like a black-and-white bird, the upper parts
and breast appear black, and the lower parts
white. Closer inspection, however, reveals a
livery of many colours, each of which has a
beautiful sheen. There is a patch on the
crown which appears metallic lilac in some
lights and emerald green in others. The neck
and upper back are dull crimson, the lower
back, chin, and throat are brilliant metallic
purple. The tail and wing feathers are dark
brown. There is a maroon collar below the
throat. The lower plumage is bright yellow.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Upper plumage earthy brown, lower
parts yellow.</p>
<p>Found in all parts of India except N.W. F. P.,
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Punjab, U.P., Behar, Assam, and Burma. Very
common in S. India. (Illus. B. P., p. 80; also
B. B., p. 62, and G. B., p. 40, and I. F., p. 128).</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Pittas</i>, 109</h3>
<p>Pittas are unique birds. They are about the
size of a quail and are characterised by their
short tails and legs and their many-coloured
plumage. They feed upon the ground, but
when alarmed they take refuge in bushes.
They are never seen far from cover. They
have a cheery whistling song.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_109">109</a>. <i>Pitta brachyura</i>: The Indian Pitta.
(F. 933), (J. 345), (II.)</p>
<p>The natives call this species the <i>Naurang</i>
(nine colours) on account of its many colours.</p>
<p>The crown is yellow tinged with orange and
divided in the middle by a broad black band
running from the beak to the nape of the neck,
where it meets a broader black band that
passes below the eye. The eyebrow is white.
The back and shoulders are dull bluish green.
There is a patch of pale blue feathers over the
tail and a patch of the same colour on the wing.
The feathers of the wing and tail are black
tipped with blue. There is a white bar in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
wing visible only during flight. Chin and
throat are white, breast orange-yellow. There
is a large crimson patch under the tail.</p>
<p>Not found in N.W. F. P., Punjab, Eastern
Bengal, Assam, or Burma. It is nowhere
abundant, but fairly common in Madras.
(Illus. B. D., p. 108; also I. F., p. 256.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Woodpeckers</i>, 110 <i>and</i> 111</h3>
<p>A general description of the woodpeckers is
scarcely necessary. They feed exclusively on
insects, which they pick off the trunks of trees,
tapping the same with their chisel-like beak to
drive their quarry from its lair. They are
very skilled climbers, moving up and down the
tree trunk in a series of jerks; the head is always
pointing upwards. Their powers of
flight are not great, they progress through the
air in a series of undulations, uttering their
peculiar harsh cries. They excavate their
nests in the trunks of trees. A great many
woodpeckers exist in India, but only two
species are widely distributed.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_110">110</a>. <i>Liopicus mahrattensis</i>: The Yellow-fronted
Pied Woodpecker. (F. 972), (J. 160),
(-II.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>A spotted black-and-white bird, with a
yellow patch on the forehead. The cock has in
addition a short red crest. There is also a
patch of red on the abdomen.</p>
<p>Not found in Eastern Bengal and Assam.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_111">111</a>. <i>Brachypternus aurantius</i>: The Golden-backed
Woodpecker. (F. 986), (J. 180), (+III.)</p>
<p>Bright crimson crest. Top of head black.
Sides of head white, with a number of black
lines and streaks. Upper back golden yellow.
Lower back and tail black. Wings black and
golden yellow, with some white spots. It has
a loud screaming call, which it constantly
utters.</p>
<p>Not found in Assam. Common in all other
parts of India. (Illus. F. III., p. 14; also B. C.,
p. 65.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_112">112</a>. <i>Iynx torquilla</i>: The Common Wryneck.
(F. 1003), (J. 188), (+I.)</p>
<p>An inconspicuous grey-brownish bird,
streaked, speckled, and mottled all over its
plumage. In some respects its habits are those
of the woodpecker, but it rarely if ever climbs
high up a tree, it is usually seen picking insects
off a tree stump or a mound. It has a peculiar
habit of twisting its head round, hence its
name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>It is a winter visitor to the plains of India,
but can scarcely be called a common bird.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Barbets</i>, 113 <i>and</i> 114</h3>
<p>Barbets are tree-haunting birds with thick
bills. They have loud monotonous calls of
two or three notes, which they repeat eternally.
They nest in holes in trees, which they excavate
with their thick stout bills, in woodpecker
fashion. The entrance to the nest is
a perfectly circular hole, like that leading to a
woodpecker&rsquo;s nest, but considerably smaller.
Barbets, when calling, move the head, so that
it is not easy to locate the bird from its call.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_113">113</a>. <i>Thereiceryx zeylonicus</i>: The Common
Green Barbet. (F. 1008), (J. 193), (III.)</p>
<p>A rich leaf-green bird, with a brownish head
and a large brown patch round the eye devoid
of feathers.</p>
<p>During the latter part of the cold weather
and the early part of the hot weather it makes
the <i>bagh</i> where it occurs resound with its loud,
penetrating, monotonous <i>kutur, kutur, kutur</i>.
The bird starts by uttering a harsh laugh&mdash;<i>tur-r-r-r</i>&mdash;this
is followed by a long succession
of <i>kuturs</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Not found in Punjab, Sind, Rajputana, Lower
Bengal, or the East Coast of the Madras
presidency.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_114">114</a>. <i>Xanthol&aelig;ma h&aelig;matocephala</i>: The Crimson-breasted
Barbet, or Coppersmith. (F. 1019), (J. 197), (+I.)</p>
<p>An olive-green bird with very gaudy colouring
on the head. I quote the following description
from <i>Bombay Ducks</i>: The bird
&ldquo;always puts me in mind of a woman who
&lsquo;makes up&rsquo; very carelessly, who is not only
exceedingly lavish of the paint, but does not
understand how to shade it off gradually. The
general colour of the bird&rsquo;s plumage is greenish,
but on close inspection many greyish white
feathers are seen to be mingled with the green
ones. There is a daub of crimson on the
forehead and another on the throat. The
sides of the face are pale yellow. The legs are
coral red. The build of the bird is exceedingly
coarse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the coppersmith is a bird that is usually
heard rather than seen. Its monotonous
metallic <i>tonk, tonk, tonk</i>, like the tapping of
a hammer on metal, is one of the most familiar
sounds of the Indian country-side. This cry is
heard only in the hot weather, and the warmer
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the day the more vigorously does the bird call.
(Illus. B. D., p. 246; also B. B., p. 57.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_115">115</a>. <i>Coracias indica</i>: The Indian Roller,
or &ldquo;Blue Jay.&rdquo; (F. 1022), (J. 123), (+III.)</p>
<p>This is a most familiar bird. Its head and
neck, throat and shoulders, are the colour of a
faded port-wine stain. Its wings and tail are
composed of alternate broad bands of light and
dark blue. These organs are not very much
<i>en evidence</i> when the bird is perched; but
flight transforms it; as it flaps heavily along
it is a study in Oxford and Cambridge blue.</p>
<p>It is found in most parts of India, but not
in the island of Bombay.</p>
<p>It nests at the beginning of the hot weather
in a hole in a building or a decayed tree. At
the breeding season it is very noisy, uttering
strange hoarse cries as it performs weird antics
in the air, or, sitting on a perch, it every now
and again utters a loud <i>tshock</i>, accompanied
by a vibration of the tail.</p>
<p>In Burma this species is replaced by an allied
one&mdash;<i>Coracias affinis</i>&mdash;the Burmese Roller.
(Illus. B. D., p. 112; also B. P., p. 12, and
B. C. cover.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Bee-eaters</i>, 116 <i>and</i> 117</h3>
<p>Bee-eaters are brightly coloured birds of
elegant form. They are characterised by
having the median pair of tail feathers prolonged
a couple of inches beyond the others
as bristles. The feeding habits of these birds
are like those of flycatchers. They make from
some perch little sallies in the air after insects.
The wings when spread are triangular in shape.
They excavate their nests in sandbanks.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_116">116</a>. <i>Merops viridis</i>: The Common Indian
Bee-eater. (F. 1026), (J. 117), (I, but with
rather a long tail.)</p>
<p>An emerald-green bird with a turquoise
throat, black necklace, and a black band through
the eye. The wings are shot with bronze, so
that, as the bird sails along on outstretched
pinions, it looks now green, now bronze, as
the rays of the sun are reflected at different
angles. There is some black in the tail, and
the two median tail feathers project as bristles
a couple of inches beyond the other tail
feathers. The eye is bright red.</p>
<p>Found all over India, but undergoes a considerable
amount of local migration. It is a
summer visitor to the Punjab and N.W. F. P.,
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
and is said to leave the island of Bombay in
the hot weather. (Illus. B. D., p. 82; also
B. B., p. 42, and G. B., p. 64.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_117">117</a>. <i>Merops philippinus</i>: The Blue-tailed
Bee-eater. (F. 1027), (J. 118), (II, but with
rather a long tail.)</p>
<p>General hue green, shot with bronze; the
tail is bluish. There is a broad black streak
running through the eye. The chin is a dirty
cream colour. The throat is chestnut-red.
The eye is bright red.</p>
<p>This species is a larger and less beautiful
edition of No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_116">116</a>. Like the latter it undergoes
partial migration, being a summer visitor
to N. India and a winter visitor to S. India.
One sees large numbers of these birds when
out snipe shooting in Madras. They perch on
the <i>bands</i> between the flooded fields and make
sallies into the air after insects. The note is
a feeble but mellow whistle.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Kingfishers</i>, 118-120</h3>
<p>These form a very well-marked group of
piscatorial birds, characterised by long bills
and short tails. They nest in holes in river
banks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_118">118</a>. <i>Ceryle varia</i>: The Indian Pied Kingfisher.
(F. 1033), (J. 136), (III.)</p>
<p>This bird must be familiar to every Anglo-Indian,
it is the &ldquo;Pied Fish-tiger&rdquo; of Sir
Edwin Arnold. It is speckled black and white
like a Hamburgh fowl. It seeks its quarry by
hanging in the air on rapidly vibrating wings
high above the water. Suddenly its pinions
cease quivering, and it drops like a stone into
the water. Sometimes it checks its fall before
reaching the water, and flies to another part of
the <i>jhil</i>, where it again hovers.</p>
<p>It is impossible to mistake this bird; there
is no other like it save its larger Himalayan
brother (<i>C. lugubris</i>). It has a small crest.
(Illus. B. D., p. 66; also I. F., p. 162.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_119">119</a>. <i>Alcedo ispida</i>: The Common Kingfisher.
(F. 1035), (J. 134), (II, but with a
very short tail.)</p>
<p>This bird, which is to be found in all parts
of India where there is a river, a tank, or a
pool of water, is the kingfisher with which we
are familiar in England.</p>
<p>Its head and nape are blue with faint black
cross bars. The back is bright pale blue; the
tail is dark blue; the wings greenish blue.
The sides of the head are studies in red, blue,
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
black, and white. The chin is whitish or
cream-coloured, and the lower parts are rusty-red.
The bill is black; the feet are coral-red.</p>
<p>Its habit is to perch on a bough overhanging
the water, or on the river bank itself, and
thence to dive obliquely into the water after
its quarry. Its flight is low, straight, and very
rapid; when in motion it continually utters
a peculiar whistling scream. Its neck is very
short, and as it sits waiting for its quarry it
keeps raising and lowering its head in the most
comical manner. (Illus. B. D., p. 102; also

<p><a class="db" id="bird_120">120</a>. <i>Halcyon smyrnensis</i>: The White-breasted
Kingfisher. (F. 1044), (J. 129), (III.)</p>
<p>This beautiful bird must be familiar to
every Anglo-Indian.</p>
<p>The head and nape are rich chocolate brown,
as is the abdomen. The back, tail, and wings
are bright blue. During flight the wings display
a very conspicuous white band. The
chin, throat, and breast are white. The bill
is dark red, and the feet bright red. It is
impossible to mistake this bird; a rapidly
flying, bright blue bird, with white wing bars,
which emits a loud scream, is without doubt
this species.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>It is often found far from water, since it
feeds largely on insects, which it picks off the
ground in much the same way as the roller or
so-called blue jay does.</p>
<p>The above three kingfishers are among the
commonest birds of India. There are several
other species of more restricted distribution;
but as these are only common locally, I have
not included them in this work. The reader
should experience no difficulty in identifying
them with the aid of the descriptions in the
<i>Fauna of British India</i>. (Illus. B. D., p. 104;
also B. P., p. 4.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Hornbills</i>, 121 <i>and</i> 122</h3>
<p>These include some of the strangest forms in
nature. They are often erroneously called
Toucans by Anglo-Indians. Toucans do not
occur in India. Hornbills are characterised
by the enormous development of the bill. I
have elsewhere described the largest of the
hornbills as follows: <i>Dichoceros bicornis</i> is
&ldquo;nearly 4&frac12; feet in length. The body is only
14 inches long, being an insignificant part
of the bird, a mere connecting link between
the massive beak and the great loosely inserted
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
tail. The beak is nearly a foot in length, and
is rendered more conspicuous than it would
otherwise be by a structure known as a casque.
This is a horny excrescence nearly as large
as the bill, which causes the bird to look as
though it were wearing a hat, which it had
placed for a joke on its beak rather than its
head. The eye is red, and the upper lid is
fringed with eyelashes which add still further
to the oddity of the bird&rsquo;s appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nesting habits of these birds are curious.
They nestle in holes in trees. When the eggs
are laid the hen goes into the hole, the entrance
to which is plastered up by the cock
and hen until the orifice is only just large
enough to allow of the insertion of the beak.
Thus the hen remains a voluntary prisoner
until the young are ready to leave the nest, the
cock bringing food to her.</p>
<p>The great majority of hornbills are confined
to the large forests, and so cannot be called
common birds. Two of the smaller species,
however, are more widely distributed. (Illus.
F. III., p. 140.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_121">121</a>. <i>Lophoceros birostris</i>: The Common
Grey Hornbill. (F. 1062), (J. 144), (IV, but
with the tail a foot long.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>A large brownish-grey bird, darkest on the
sides of the head and palest on the lower parts.
The bill, which has a small casque or excrescence
on top, is blackish and 4 inches long.
It is a tree-haunting species. Its cry is very
characteristic. Its flight is laboured, consisting
of &ldquo;alternate flappings and sailings,&rdquo; like that
of the tree-pie.</p>
<p>This species is common in Oudh. Blanford
states that it is wanting in the Punjab. This is
not correct, as I have seen it in Lahore. I have
not observed it in the vicinity of Madras.
Eha does not mention it in his common
<i>Birds of Bombay</i>, nor does it appear to be found
in the neighbourhood of Calcutta.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_122">122</a>. <i>Lophoceros griseus</i>: The Malabar Grey
Hornbill. (F. 1063), (J. 145), (IV, but with
tail 9 inches long.)</p>
<p>This is very like <a class="rb" href="#bird_121">121</a>, but it lacks the casque.
It is the common hornbill of the West Coast.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Hoopoes</i>, 123</h3>
<p>Hoopoes are ground-feeding birds, characterised
by their long slightly curved bill and
conspicuous crest, which ordinarily projects
from the back of the head and looks like a
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
backward continuation of the beak. When the
bird is disturbed and when it flies the crest is
expanded like a fan. Almost every lawn in
India forms the feeding-ground for at least
one pair of hoopoes. Hoopoes nest in holes
in trees or in the walls of buildings.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_123">123</a>. <i>Upupa indica</i>: The Indian Hoopoe.
(F. 1067), (J. 255), (III.)</p>
<p>Head and body fawn-coloured. Wings and
tail white with very broad black bars. The
beak is 2&frac12; inches long, and the legs are very
short. The feathers of the crest have black
tips. The note is a soft <i>&#363;k&mdash;&#363;k&mdash;&#363;k</i>, rapidly
repeated. (Illus. B. D., p. 140.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Swifts</i>, 124 <i>and</i> 125</h3>
<p>These birds are frequently confounded with
<a href="#bird_88">swallows</a> (q.v.). Many species visit India, but
only two are really common birds.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_124">124</a>. <i>Cypselus affinis</i>: The Common Indian
Swift. (F. 1073), (J. 100), (-I.)</p>
<p>A blackish bird, with a white bar across the
back, which flies with great velocity; the
wings form the arc of a circle as it dashes
through the air. It never perches. When it
wishes to rest it repairs to its nest, which is
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
a saucer-shaped structure made of mud, bits of straw, feathers, etc., usually fixed on to a
wall under an eave, sometimes in a deserted temple or mosque. (Illus. B. B., p. 35.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_125">125</a>. <i>Tachornis batassiensis</i>: The Palm-swift (F. 1075), (J. 102), (-I.)</p>
<p>A brownish-black bird. Its habits are like
those of No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_124">124</a>, except that its flight is less
swift and it is rarely found away from palm
trees. It attaches its nest to the under side
of a palm leaf, or a betel-nut leaf.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Nightjars</i>, 126 <i>and</i> 127</h3>
<p>These birds are very nocturnal in their
habits, so, like the heroine of <i>The Diary of a
Bad Girl</i>, they are heard and not seen.</p>
<p>They are characterised by the large mouth,
which enables them to secure their insect
quarry while they are on the wing. They
usually lie up during the day on the ground in
some secluded spot.</p>

a number of narrow blackish cross bars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>The voice of this bird must be familiar to
many residents in India, it sounds like a stone

<h3 class="genus"><i>The Cuckoos</i>, 128-131</h3>
<p>This large family falls into two classes&mdash;the
parasitic and the non-parasitic&mdash;both classes
being represented in India.</p>
<p>The European cuckoo is very abundant in
the Himalayas, but is rarely seen or heard in
the plains.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_128">128</a>. <i>Hierococcyx varius</i>: The Common
Hawk-Cuckoo&mdash;the Brain-fever bird of Anglo-Indians.
(F. 1109), (J. 205), (-III, but with
a tail 6 inches long.)</p>
<p>Every Anglo-Indian is familiar with the
<i>crescendo</i> shriek&mdash;brain-fever, <i>brain-fever</i>, <span class="small">BRAIN
FEVER</span>&mdash;of this bird, which is reiterated with
such &ldquo;damnable persistency&rdquo; at the beginning
of the hot weather. This bird is exceedingly
common in the United Provinces. It is
less abundant in other parts of India. It does
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
not appear to occur west of Umballa; I never
heard it in Madras, and it does not seem to occur
in the island of Bombay. It is impossible to
miss it where it does occur. There is no mistaking
its note. It is a greyish-brown bird
with whitish under parts, each feather having
darker cross bars. The bird is very hawk-like
in appearance, hence its name.</p>
<p>It is parasitic on &ldquo;The Seven Sisters&rdquo; and
other kinds of babblers. (Illus. B. C., p. 95.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_129">129</a>. <i>Coccystes jacobinus</i>: The Pied-crested

<p>Upper plumage glossy black, with a broad
white wing-bar, and white tips to the tail
feathers. The chin, throat, and under parts
are white. A conspicuous black crest.</p>
<p>This species is very common &ldquo;on the Bombay

high-pitched cries.</p>
<p>It is parasitic on various species of babblers.

<p><i>Cock</i>: A glossy black bird with a green bill
and crimson eye. As he flies he looks like a
slenderly built crow with an unusually long tail.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: A brown bird, spotted and barred all
over with white. Bill and eye as in cock. This
is an exceedingly noisy bird, and is most vociferous
at dawn. It has three distinct calls. The
commonest is a <i>crescendo</i>: ku-il, <i>ku-il</i>, <span class="small">KU-IL</span>,
whence its name. Another call is <i>ku-y-o</i>. The
third is a torrent of <i>kekaree, kekarees</i>. (Illus.
B. D., pp. 218 and 220; also B. C., p. 92.)</p>
<p>It is parasitic on crows.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_131">131</a>. <i>Centropus sinensis</i>: The Common Coucal,
or Crow-Pheasant. (F. 1130), (J. 217), (-IV, but with a tail 10 inches long.)</p>
<p>A great black fowl with chestnut-red wings.
It feeds largely on the ground, and its long
tail sometimes causes the &ldquo;griff&rdquo; to mistake
it for a pheasant.</p>
<p>Its call, which is heard at all times of the
day, but more especially at dawn, is a low,
loud, sonorous <i>whoot, whoot, whoot</i>, the kind of
call that one associates with an owl.</p>
<p>It is not parasitic, but builds a large domed nest in the innermost recesses of a dense
thicket. (Illus. I. F., p. 80. [Illustration not a good one.])</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>

Cuckoo. (F. 1129), (J. 222), (IV.)</p>
<p>This bird, although nowhere abundant, is widely distributed. It has the appearance of
a large long-tailed babbler, and when it runs along the ground it looks like a mongoose. It
is an earthy brown bird. The outer tail feathers are black with white tips. The bill is cherry-red;
this, perhaps, is the reason why Indians call the bird <i>Jangli tota</i>. Like the crow-pheasant
it builds a nest.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Green Parrots</i>, 132-134</h3>
<p>Every dweller in India must be familiar with
these noisy birds, both in the captive and the
wild state. They go about in small flocks,
looking like &ldquo;live emeralds in the sun,&rdquo; and
uttering loud screams and harsh cries. During
flight they turn from side to side &ldquo;like badly
balanced arrows.&rdquo; They nestle in holes in
trees or buildings.</p>
<p>Three species are to be numbered among the
common birds of India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_132">132</a>. <i>Pal&aelig;ornis nepalensis</i>: The Alexandrine
or Large Indian Paroquet. (F. 1135), (J. 147),
(+III, but with a tail over a foot long.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>A beautiful grass-green bird, with some blue
in the tail and a red patch on each shoulder.
The cock has a rose-coloured collar round the
back of his neck, which is connected with the
bill on each side by a black stripe.</p>
<p>Found in N. and C. India. Very common
in the Punjab.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_133">133</a>. <i>Pal&aelig;ornis torquatus</i>: The Rose-ringed
Paroquet. (F. 1138), (J. 148), (-III, but with

<p>A small edition of No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_132">132</a>, but lacks the
red patch on the shoulders.</p>
<p>The commonest of the green parrots, and
found all over the plains of India. (Illus. B. P.,
p. 18; also I. F., p. 220.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_134">134</a>. <i>Pal&aelig;ornis cyanocephalus</i>: The Western
Blossom-headed Paroquet. (F. 1139), (J. 149),
(II, but with a tail over 8 inches long.)</p>
<p><i>Cock</i>: General colour bright grass-green.
The head is red, tinged with blue, as Blanford
says, like the bloom on a plum. There is a red
patch on the shoulders, as in the case of No.
<a class="rb" href="#bird_132">132</a>. The median tail feathers are pale blue.</p>
<p><i>Hen</i>: Differs from the cock in that the head
is duller, being of a grey rather than a red hue.</p>
<p>Not found in N.W. F. P. or the Punjab.
Commoner in South than in North India.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Owls</i>, 135-139</h3>
<p>Owls form a well-marked natural order. It
is easy enough to recognise an owl when one
sees one, but not easy to say to what species
it belongs, because all owls bear a strong resemblance
to one another&mdash;all are of much
the same colour&mdash;reddish brown with darker
bars or drops. Moreover, they are all creatures
of the night, so, save with one exception,
are not much <i>en evidence</i> in the daytime. This
exception is that little clown, the spotted owlet.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_135">135</a>. <i>Athene brama</i>: The Spotted Owlet.
(F. 1180), (J. 76), (II.)</p>
<p>A small owl; upper plumage earthy brown
or grey in colour, copiously spotted and barred
with white. Lower plumage white with dark
brown spots and cross bars.</p>
<p>It comes out long before sunset and pours
forth a volley of chuckles and squeaks; two
of these individuals often shouting at once.
When it catches sight of a human being it
stares at him with its bright golden orbs and,
as Eha observes, bows with sarcastic effect.
No one who has dwelt any length of time in
India can fail to have remarked this very noisy
little owl. It nests in holes of trees or in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
walls of bungalows. This is the only owl which
can be classed as a familiar bird. Three other
species, however, are often seen, namely
(Illus. B. D., p. 256; also B. P., p. 94, and
B. B., p. 29):</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_136">136</a>. <i>Strix flammea</i>: The Barn Owl or
Screech Owl. (F. 1152), (J. 60), (IV.)</p>
<p>This is a reddish-brown bird barred with
narrow white and black bars. It has a long
heart-shaped face, which is white.</p>
<p>It is very nocturnal in its habits; when it
does get abroad in the daytime it is promptly
mobbed by the crows. Its cry is a weird screech,
and it is regarded by the people as a bird of
evil omen.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_137">137</a>. <i>Asio accipitrinus</i>: The Short-eared
Owl. (F. 1157), (J. 68), (+IV.)</p>
<p>A large buff bird barred all over with dark
brown. It lies up during the day in grass, and
is often flushed by sportsmen. Sometimes
three or four are flushed together. It is a
winter visitor to India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_138">138</a>. <i>Scops giu</i>: The Scops Owl. (F. 1173),
(J. 74), (-II.)</p>
<p>This may be distinguished from the spotted
owlet by the fact that it possesses &ldquo;horns&rdquo;
or ear-tufts. Like most other owls it is heard
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
more often than seen. Its note, which must
be familiar to all who have camped in India, is
a single hoot, which is repeated monotonously
at regular intervals of about ten seconds.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_139">139</a>. <i>Glaucidium radiatum</i>: The Jungle
Owlet. (F. 1184), (J. 78), (-II.)</p>
<p>This owl is very like <a class="rb" href="#bird_135">135</a> in appearance, and
has a peculiar protracted call which must be
familiar to those who have camped in the U. P.</p>
<p>It does not appear to occur in the N.W.
F. P., the Punjab, the Deccan, or Bombay.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_140">140</a>. <i>Pandion halia&euml;tus</i>: The Osprey. (F. 1189), (J. 40), (-V.)</p>
<p>This looks very like a kite when seen as it
perches on a stone, but is distinguishable from
the kite by the fact that its head and neck are
white, save for a broad dark band which runs
from the eye down the side of the neck.</p>
<p>When seeking for food, however, nothing is
easier than to identify the osprey. Like the
pied kingfisher the great bird poises itself in
the air on quivering wings high above the
water. Suddenly its wings close and it drops
down like a falling stone and disappears into
the water with a huge splash, to emerge a
second or two later with a fish in its talons.</p>
<p>In the cold weather the osprey is to be seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
in most places where there are large <i>jhils</i> or
backwaters.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Vultures</i>, 141-145</h3>
<p>These are huge birds of prey which feed exclusively
on carrion. They are distinguished
by the fact that their head and neck are
destitute of feathers. A large bird of prey
with bare head and neck is undoubtedly a
vulture.</p>
<p>Vultures, as everyone knows, stay for hours
floating on outstretched wings high up in the
air, looking out for dead animals. Kites and
other birds of prey remain for long periods on
the wing; they, too, can sail and soar, but
they do not literally hang in the air as the
vultures do. As these latter float in the air it
will be observed that their wings project
straight out at right angles to the body. The
commonest species of vulture are:</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_141">141</a>. <i>Otogyps calvus</i>: The Black or Pondicherry
Vulture. (F. 1191), (J. 2), (+V,
nearly twice the size of the kite.)</p>
<p>A black bird with a red head, a white waist-coat,
and a white patch on each thigh.</p>
<p>Rare in the Punjab and Sind.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_142">142</a>. <i>Gyps indicus</i>: The Indian Long-billed Vulture. (F. 1194), (J. 4), (+V, over a yard in length.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Uniform brownish grey; the hue varying with individuals.</p>
<p>Not found in Sind.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_143">143</a>. <i>Pseudogyps bengalensis</i>: The Indian White-backed Vulture. (F. 1196), (J. 5),
(+V. Between <a class="rb" href="#bird_141">141</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_142">142</a> in size.)</p>
<p>This is the commonest vulture in India. It
is very dark grey, almost black. The naked
head is rather lighter than the rest of the body.
The lower back is white, and this makes the
bird easy to identify. It has some white in
the wings, and this during flight is visible as a
broad white band that runs from the body
nearly to the tip of the wing. Thus the wing
from below appears to be white with very
broad black edges. (Illus. B. B., p. 9.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_144">144</a>. <i>Neophron ginginianus</i>: The Smaller
White Scavenger Vulture. (F. 1197), (J. 6), (V.)</p>
<p>This familiar creature I have named &ldquo;The
ugliest bird in the world.&rdquo; I reproduce the
description of the bird from <i>Bombay Ducks</i>:
&ldquo;There is no other creature like unto it. It
is about the size of a kite. Its plumage is
dirty white, except the tips of the wings,
which are shabby black. The neck is covered
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
with feathers, which stick out like the back
hairs of a schoolboy. These are, if possible,
rather dirtier-looking than the rest of the
plumage, and frequently assume a rusty hue.
Its bill is yellow, so are its naked face and its
legs. As &lsquo;Eha&rsquo; remarks: &lsquo;It does not stand
upright like the true vultures, but carries its
body like a duck and steps like a recruit.&rsquo; . . .
It is a good flier, and when seen on the wing
looks quite a respectable bird. The under
parts of its wings appear pure white in the
sunlight, and the black border gives them a
finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young scavenger vultures are sooty brown
when they leave the nest and look like a
different species.</p>
<p>This creature feeds on human ordure and
haunts the neighbourhood of latrines. It is
known to Thomas Atkins as the Shawk. It is
also called Pharaoh&rsquo;s Chicken. (Illus. B. D.,
pp. 278 and 280.)</p>
<p>In the Punjab it is replaced by a species
which resembles it in all characters, differing
only in being a little larger. This species is:</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_145">145</a>. <i>Neophron percnopterus</i>: The Egyptian
Vulture, or Large White Scavenger Vulture.
(F. 1198), (J. 6), (+V.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Birds of Prey</i>, 146-162</h3>
<p>This large family is composed of birds which
bear so strong a family likeness that it is almost
impossible to describe them in such a way as
to enable the reader to identify them at sight.
As with the owls, birds of prey are easily
recognised as such, but to name any particular
species baffles even professed ornithologists.
To try to make out the raptores by their
colour is, to use the words of Eha, &ldquo;at the
best a short road to despair. Naturalists learn
to recognise them as David&rsquo;s watchman recognised
the courier who brought tidings of the
victory over Absalom. &lsquo;His running is like the
running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok.&rsquo; Every
bird of prey has its own character, some trick
of flight, something in its figure and proportions
which serves to distinguish it decisively.&rdquo;
What precisely this something is I am not in
most cases able to state. I trust that before
long Mr. C. H. Donald, or some other Indian
falconer, will give us a little handbook on the
birds of prey of this country. For my part I
am able merely to attempt a description of two
or three of the very commonest forms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_146">146</a>. <i>Aquila vindhiana</i>: The Indian Tawny
Eagle. (F. 1203), (J. 29), (+V.)</p>
<p>In colouring this bird is very like the common
kite, but has not so long a tail; and its legs are
feathered right down to the toe&mdash;this is the
sign-manual of all the true eagles. A bird that
looks like a kite with feathered legs is probably
a tawny eagle&mdash;the commonest eagle in India,
abundant everywhere save on the Malabar
coast.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_147">147</a>. <i>Butastur teesa</i>: The White-eyed Buzzard.
(F. 1220), (J. 48), (IV.)</p>
<p>This bird of prey is about the size of the
common house crow. Eha writes, &ldquo;A Buzzard&rsquo;s
idea of life is to sit upon a pole, or on top of a
small tree commanding a good expanse of grass
land, and to watch for a field mouse, or a lizard,
or even a fat grasshopper. If you see a biggish,
untidy hawk, of a sandy brown colour, more or
less dashed with whitish, spending the morning
in this way, you may put it down as <i>Butastur
teesa</i>.&rdquo; The sign-manual of this common bird
is its white eye, and if you cannot get near
enough to make this out with the aid of field
glasses, you may still identify this species by
the conspicuous white patch on the nape of

<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Very common in N. India; rare in the
south.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_148">148</a>. <i>Halia&euml;tus leucoryphus</i>: Pallas&rsquo;s Fishing
Eagle. (F. 1223), (J. 42), (+V; nearly half as
big again as the kite.)</p>
<p>A large brown bird with whitish forehead,
chin, and throat, and a broad white band
(4 inches wide) across the tail, about three
inches from the tip. This is the sign-manual of
this species, and on this account Jerdon calls
it &ldquo;The Ring-tailed Fish Eagle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not found in S. India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the fish-eagles,&rdquo; writes C. H. Donald
in <i>The Indian Field</i>, &ldquo;have loud resonant
calls, anything but melodious, and each and all
seem to love hearing their own voices. <i>H.
leucoryphus</i> in the plains of the Punjab may
often be heard long before he is seen, particularly
when soaring, and though he himself may
only appear a wee speck in the heavens, his
call will be distinctly heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bird frequents rivers and marshes, and
is an inland rather than a seashore bird.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_149">149</a>. <i>Halia&euml;tus leucogaster</i>: The White-bellied
Sea-Eagle. (F. 1224), (J. 43), (V. a little larger than the kite.)</p>
<p>Head, neck, lower parts, and nearly the
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
whole of the tail white; other parts dark
grey or brown. Jerdon calls this species the
Grey-backed Sea-Eagle. This species is very
seldom seen inland, and is easily distinguished
from Nos. <a class="rb" href="#bird_148">148</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_150">150</a> by having the lower
parts white instead of brown.</p>
<p>Col. Cunningham describes this species as
&ldquo;one of the most splendid of large raptorial
birds, owing to the brilliant contrast of the
snowy whiteness of the head and under surface,
with the deep ashy tints of the wings and back.
There are few more striking objects than one
of them as he sits on a bare branch overhanging
a tidal channel, glancing around with his bold
black eyes, and with all his beautiful plumage
gleaming in the bright sunlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a very noisy species, especially at the
breeding season.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_150">150</a>. <i>Halia&euml;tus albicilla</i>: The White-tailed
Sea-Eagle. (F. 1225), (+V; half as big again as a kite.)</p>
<p>A large brown bird with a white tail, of which the middle feathers are considerably longer
than the outer ones. By this character and by its loud cries may this bird be identified. It is
only a winter visitor to India&mdash;to the Punjab, Sind, and the U. P.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_151">151</a>. <i>Haliastur indus</i>: The Brahminy Kite.
(F. 1228), (J. 55), (-V.)</p>
<p>Of all the birds of prey this is perhaps the easiest to identify in its adult state. The
head, neck, breast, and upper abdomen are white, the shaft of each white feather being
black. The remainder of the plumage is a rich chestnut, almost maroon.</p>
<p>The young are very like the common kite in appearance, but may be distinguished when on
the wing by the fact that the tail of the Brahminy is always rounded, while that of the
kite is more or less forked.</p>
<p>This species is rare in the Punjab, common everywhere else. In Madras it sometimes
swoops down and carries off a snipe that has been shot by a sportsman. Its cry is a peculiar
squeaking wail. (Illus. B. D., p. 190.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_152">152</a>. <i>Milvus govinda</i>: The Common Pariah
Kite. (F. 1229), (J. 56), (V.)</p>
<p>Description of this ubiquitous bird is unnecessary. His long tail, slightly forked at the
tip, suffices to distinguish him at a glance from all other raptorial birds. (Illus. B. D., p. 182;
also B. P., p. 148.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_153">153</a>. <i>Circus macrurus</i>: The Pale Harrier. (F. 1233), (J. 51), (+IV.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_154">154</a>. <i>Circus cineraceus</i>: Montagu&rsquo;s Harrier. (F. 1234), (J. 52), (+IV.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_155">155</a>. <i>Circus cyaneus</i>: The Hen Harrier. (F. 1235), (J. 50), (-V.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_156">156</a>. <i>Circus melanoleucus</i>: The Pied Harrier. (F. 1236), (J. 53), (+IV.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_157">157</a>. <i>Circus &aelig;ruginosus</i>: The Marsh Harrier. (F. 1237), (J. 54), (-V.)</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to describe these birds, as, although it may be possible to tell the male
birds apart, the hens are so alike that to distinguish them is no easy matter. The ordinary
man will doubtless be satisfied to call them all harriers.</p>
<p>Harriers are cold-weather visitors to India. They are striking-looking birds with long wings.
They fly low, only a few inches above the level of the ground, ever on the look out for a
lizard, a mouse, an insect, or even a small bird. They are larger than crows and smaller than
kites. They hunt over fields and marshes, and are not seen in towns, but those who shoot
must be familiar with them. (Illus. B. B., p. 15.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_158">158</a>. <i>Astur badius</i>: The Shikra. (F. 1244), (J. 23), (+III.)</p>
<p>This is one of the most familiar birds of prey.
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
It is considerably smaller than the common
house crow. Its upper plumage is ashy grey.
The tail is of the same hue, but with broad
black cross bars. The breast is pale rust colour,
with a number of thin wavy white cross bars.
The eye is bright yellow, as is the cere or base
of the beak. It is very like the Brain-fever
Bird in appearance. It often hunts for its
quarry in the neighbourhood of trees. Its
method is to make a short quick dash. Natives
of India very frequently train this bird to hawk
quail and mynas. Its note is a sharp double
whistle.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_159">159</a>. <i>Accipiter nisus</i>: The Sparrow-Hawk. (F. 1247), (J. 24), (+III.)</p>
<p>This species, which is a cold-weather visitor
to India, is very like No. 158 in habits and
appearance. It is, however, characterised by
having long legs. It is bolder and swifter in
its movements. (Illus. B. D., p. 84; also B. B., p. 21.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_160">160</a>. <i>Falco jugger</i>: The Laggar Falcon. (F. 1257), (J. 11), (+III.)</p>
<p>Several species of falcon occur in India. This one is, I think, the commonest.</p>
<p>It is a brownish bird barred and spotted all
over with white. It looks like a large sparrow-hawk
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
with long pointed wings. But it does not make one dash at its prey after the manner of
the sparrow-hawk; it is a strong flier and settles down to a long chase in the open country. Its
eyes are dark. Natives call falcons dark-eyed hawks, and sparrow-hawks light-eyed hawks.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_161">161</a>. <i>&AElig;salon chicquera</i>: The Turumti, or
Red-headed Merlin. (F. 1264), (J. 16), (+III.)</p>
<p>Head and a stripe on the cheek chestnut. Back and tail grey barred with dark brown;
under parts whitish with black streaks and bars.</p>
<p>This species lives largely on small birds and often hunts in couples.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_162">162</a>. <i>Tinnunculus alaudaris</i>: The Kestrel;
the English &ldquo;Windhover.&rdquo; (F. 1265), (J. 17), (+III.)</p>
<p>Head, neck, and tail grey, back and wings brick-red. Lower parts cream-coloured spotted
with brown. The red back makes the bird easy to identify, as does its method of hunting
its quarry. It flies over the open country, and every now and then hovers on rapidly
vibrating wings over some spot where it thinks it espies some lizard or other animal. If there
is an animal there it drops quietly on it, otherwise it passes on and hovers elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is a winter visitor to the plains of India.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Green Pigeons</i>, 163-164</h3>
<p>These beautiful birds are strictly arboreal. They go about in small companies, but so
closely do they assimilate in colour to their leafy surroundings that it is difficult to make
them out. They feed exclusively on fruit.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_163">163</a>. <i>Crocopus ph&oelig;nicopterus</i>: The Bengal Green Pigeon. (F. 1271), (J. 772), (+III.)</p>
<p>A bright yellowish-green bird. Head, lower breast, and tail dove colour. Some lilac and a
yellow bar on the wing. Legs orange-yellow.</p>
<p>Found in the Eastern Punjab, U. P., and Bengal. In the Punjab, U. P., and the whole
of the peninsula of India is found the next species.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_164">164</a>. <i>Crocopus chlorogaster</i>: The Southern Green Pigeon. (F. 1272), (J. 773), (+II.)</p>
<p>This is so like No. 163 that it seems scarcely deserving of specific rank. It differs only in
having the lower breast green instead of grey.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_165">165</a>. <i>Columba intermedia</i>: The Indian Blue Rock Pigeon. (F. 1292), (J. 788), (+III.)</p>
<p>This familiar bird scarcely needs description. It is the common <i>Kabutar</i>. It is a bluish-grey
bird (light slate colour) with two broad black bars across the wing. The tip of the tail is
black; legs red.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Found all over India. In the Punjab this species meets an allied form&mdash;<i>Columba livia</i>&mdash;which
is distinguished by the fact that its lower back is white instead of slaty grey.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Doves</i>, 166-169</h3>
<p>Every one is well acquainted with these familiar birds, so that a general description of
them is unnecessary. The four species most commonly seen in India are:</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_166">166</a>. <i>Turtur suratensis</i>: The Spotted Dove. (F. 1307), (J. 795), (III.)</p>
<p>A reddish-grey bird. The sides of the neck are black with a number of small white spots.
The two median pairs of tail feathers are brown, and the others black with white tips.</p>
<p>Its note is a plaintive <i>c&#363;koo-coo-coo</i>. Like the
other three species of dove this species is
widely distributed, but is very capricious in
its distribution.</p>
<p>It is very common in Calcutta, Madras, Travancore, Tirhoot, and Lucknow, but does
not occur at Lahore, Bombay, or in the Deccan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>It is easily distinguished from the other
doves by its black tippet. (Illus. F. IV., p. 1;
also B. C., p. 123, and B. D., p. 8.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_167">167</a>. <i>Turtur cambayensis</i>: The Little Brown
Dove. (F. 1309), (J. 794), (-III; midway between the bulbul and myna in size.)</p>
<p>This pretty little dove often nests in the
verandah, building on the rolled-up <i>chiks</i>.</p>
<p>Eha thus describes it: &ldquo;Of an earthy brown
colour, passing into slaty grey on the wings and
tail, and tinged on the head, neck, and breast
with that tender tint peculiar to doves, which
the natural history books call &lsquo;vinaceous,&rsquo; like
a faded claret stain on the tablecloth. On
each side of the neck there is a miniature chessboard
in red and black. The feet are red.&rdquo;
Its call is composed of quite a little tune&mdash;a
soft, subdued, musical <i>cuk-cuk-coo-coo-coo</i>.</p>
<p>This dove is capriciously distributed. It is
common in the Punjab, U. P., Deccan, Bombay,
but absent in Lower Bengal and the
Malabar coast.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_168">168</a>. <i>Turtur risorius</i>: The Indian Ring
Dove. (F. 1310), (J. 796), (+III.)</p>
<p>This bird is a light French grey. It is distinguishable
from Nos. <a class="rb" href="#bird_166">166</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_167">167</a> by its paler
hue and by the possession of a black collar with
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
a narrow white border round the back of the
neck. Its note is a <i>ku-ku&mdash;k&#363;</i>.</p>
<p>It is common in the Punjab, U. P., and the
Deccan. It is found in Assam and S. India on
the East, but not on the West Coast, nor in
Lower Bengal.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_169">169</a>. <i>&OElig;nopopelia tranquebarica</i>: The Red
Turtle Dove. (F. 1311), (J. 797), (II.)</p>
<p>This is the smallest of the doves, and is not
nearly so abundant as the other three species.
In the U. P. it is a permanent resident, but in
the Punjab merely a summer emigrant. It
certainly is not common in most parts of South
India. It is remarkable in that the cock and
hen differ in appearance.</p>
<p>The cock is a rust-coloured bird with a black
collar round the back of his neck, and reddish
wings.</p>
<p>The hen lacks the red on the wing.</p>
<p>The note is harsh and sepulchral, more like a
grunt than a <i>coo</i>. The legs are not red as in
the other common doves.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Sand Grouse</i></h3>
<p>This family seems to form a connecting link
between the pigeons and the gallinaceous birds.
They are characterised by having feathered
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
legs. They are coloured so as to assimilate
closely to their sandy surroundings. They are
game birds. The reader is therefore referred
to Marshall and Hume&rsquo;s standard book,
in which there are coloured plates of the
various species. The order is treated of on pp. 53-63 of Vol. IV. of the Bird Volumes of <i>The
Fauna of British India</i> series. (Illus. I. G. I., pp. 43, 47, 53, 57, 59, 65, 69, 77.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_170">170</a>. <i>Pavo cristatus</i>: The Common Peafowl.
(F. 1324), (J. 803), (+V, with a long train in
the cock.)</p>
<p>Description of this familiar bird is unnecessary,
but it and its loud call, like the <i>miau</i>
of a cat, are known to all men.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Quails</i></h3>
<p>These, being game birds, do not come within
the scope of the present work. The reader is
referred to Hume and Marshall and the Bird
Volumes of <i>The Fauna of British India</i> series
for accounts of them. Since, however, one
sometimes, in the course of a walk in the cold
weather, puts up a common quail, I will
briefly describe the bird. As you walk along
you suddenly hear a rustling noise almost at
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
your feet, and before you can say &ldquo;Jack
Robinson&rdquo; a small brown bird has arisen with
a flutter and dashed off a few inches over the
tops of the heads of corn in the adjacent field.
After a flight of twenty or thirty yards the
bird drops into the corn&mdash;that is all you are
likely to see of the quail unless you shoot it or
net it.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_171">171</a>. <i>Coturnix communis</i>: The Common or
Grey Quail. (F. 1355), (J. 829), (+II, but
with a very short tail.)</p>
<p>A brown bird much spotted and barred with
black, having some white streaks along the
length of the back. Short legs.</p>
<p>A winter visitor to India. (Illus. I. G. II.,
p. 133.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Partridges</i></h3>
<p>These are game birds, and so lie outside the
scope of this book. I will, however, describe
briefly two common species, whose calls are to
be numbered among the commonest sounds
heard in the jungle.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_172">172</a>. <i>Francolinus vulgaris</i>: The Black Partridge,
or Common Francolin. (F. 1372), (J. 818), (+III.)</p>
<p>The cock is a handsome black bird, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
everywhere narrow bars of white or grey. The
sides of the head are white, and there is a
broad chestnut collar all round the neck.</p>
<p>The hen is reddish brown in most places
where the cock is black.</p>
<p>Its cry is a curious harsh crow, so high-pitched
as to be inaudible to some human
beings. Indian Muhammedans declare that
the bird calls &ldquo;<i>Sub-h&#257;n, teri kudrat</i>.&rdquo; Blanford
syllabises it as, &ldquo;<i>Juk-juk, tee-tee-tur</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is found in N. India, most abundantly in
the U. P. (Illus. I. G. II., p. 9.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_173">173</a>. <i>Francolinus pondicerianus</i>: The Grey
Partridge. (F. 1375), (J. 822), (+III.)</p>
<p>A greyish-brown bird marked all over with
thin white or buff cross bars.</p>
<p>The loud call of this bird must be familiar to
most Anglo-Indians. It is uttered early in
the morning and again at sunset. Blanford
describes it as &ldquo;beginning with two or three
single harsh notes, and continuing with a
succession of trisyllabic, shrill, ringing cries.&rdquo;
Jerdon says of this species: &ldquo;Its call is a
peculiar loud shrill cry, and has, not unaptly,
been compared to the word <i>Pateela-pateela-pateela</i>,
quickly repeated, but preceded by a
single note uttered two or three times, each
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
time with a higher intonation, till it gets, as it
were, the key-note of its call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This species runs very fast, and does not, as
a rule, take to its wings unless flushed. (I. G. II.
p. 51, but plate not a good one.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Rails</i>, 174-176</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_174">174</a>. <i>Amaurornis ph&oelig;nicurus</i>: The White-breasted
Water-hen. (F. 1401), (J. 907),
(+II.)</p>
<p>A dark slaty-grey bird, almost black, with a
white face, throat, and breast. The under
parts of the tail, which is carried almost erect,
are chestnut red. Wherever there is a pond
having near it some bamboos or rushes there
is one likely to see a water-hen. It is a great
skulker, and always makes for cover the
moment it thinks it is being watched. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo;
as Blanford remarks, &ldquo;an excessively noisy
bird; its loud, hoarse, reiterated call, predominating
in the evening and morning over
the cries of the other waders and the ducks in
the village tank, must be familiar to most
people in India.&rdquo; (Illus. B. B., p. 173.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_175">175</a>. <i>Porphyrio poliocephalus</i>: The Purple
Moorhen, or Purple Coot. (F. 1404), (J. 902),
(IV.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>A beautiful purple-blue bird with very long
red legs. The bill is red, as is a square shield
which the bird carries on its forehead. It has
a white patch under its tail. It is impossible
to mistake this bird. There is none other like
unto it in India. One frequently comes across
it when out shooting.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_176">176</a>. <i>Fulica atra</i>: The Coot. (F. 1405), (J. 903), (IV.)</p>
<p>This is the most duck-like of all the rails, and indeed is very frequently shot and eaten as
a duck by inexperienced sportsmen. However, its shining black plumage and its white bill
and shield on the forehead serve to differentiate it from all Indian ducks. Moreover,
when disturbed on the water, it experiences some difficulty in starting to fly. It runs along
the surface of the water for a few feet with vigorous flappings of the wings and much
splashing before it succeeds in lifting itself out of the water. It does not usually keep in flocks
as ducks do. It breeds in India. It does not swim so high in the water as a duck. Its feet
are not webbed, but its toes are pinnate, i.e. provided with flattened membranes which
assist it in swimming. Its bill is not so flat as that of a duck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Cranes</i>, 177-179</h3>
<p>Cranes are large, tall, long-shanked birds which have a loud, trumpet-like call. The
three common Indian species are chiefly grey in colour. They never perch in trees, but
rest and nest on the ground. When they fly they carry the neck and feet stretched out
straight. When they fly in company the flight takes a V-shaped form, like that of a flight of
geese.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_177">177</a>. <i>Grus communis</i>: The Common Crane.
(F. 1407), (J. 865), (+V; about twice the size of a kite.)</p>
<p>This bird is the <i>coolung</i> of sportsmen. Its general colour is dark French grey. Its head
is almost devoid of feathers, and there is a square, dark red patch of skin across the back
of the head. It has a broad white band running down each side of the long neck. Its
legs are black.</p>
<p>It is a winter visitor to India. It is fairly common in N. India, but rare in the south.</p>
<p>It is usually seen in flocks, which spend the middle of the day on sandbanks in the middle
of rivers. (Illus. I. G. III., p. 21.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_178">178</a>. <i>Grus antigone</i>: The Sarus. (F. 1409), (J. 863), (+V. This is the largest of the
Indian cranes, and stands nearly as high as a human being.)</p>
<p>Its general hue is French grey. Its head is devoid of feathers. Its throat and a ring round
the nape are black. Its head and neck are red. Its legs are dull red.</p>
<p>It is the most familiar of the Indian cranes. It is usually seen in pairs. It does not soar high
in the air, like the other two species. It is a permanent resident, but does not appear
to occur south of the Godaveri.</p>
<p>It is far more confidential than the other species of crane, and will sometimes allow a
human being to approach within thirty yards of it. (Illus. I. G. III., p. 1, but plate is not
good.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_179">179</a>. <i>Anthropoides virgo</i>: The Demoiselle Crane. (F. 1411), (J. 866), (+V. The smallest
of the cranes.)</p>
<p>This bird is sometimes wrongly called <i>coolung</i> by sportsmen; the Hindustani name
for it is <i>Karkarra</i>.</p>
<p>A light grey bird, with a black face and neck and some black in the wings. Behind the eye
is a streak of white feathers which ends in a long graceful white plume. Its note is harsher
and less trumpet-like than those of the other cranes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>It is a winter visitor to India. It is very
common in the Deccan, Guzerat, and Kattiwar;
less common in other parts of N. India,
and rare in Lower Bengal and S. India. Its
habits are like those of No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_177">177</a>. (Illus. F. IV.,
p. 184; also I. G. III., p. 31.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Bustards</i></h3>
<p>These come within the category of &ldquo;game birds,&rdquo; and so none of them are treated of in
this book. (Illus. I. G. I., pp. 1, 3, 7, 18.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_180">180</a>. <i>&OElig;dicnemus scolopax</i>: The Stone-Curlew,
or Stone-Plover, or Thick-knee. (F. 1418),
(J. 859), (+IV.)</p>
<p>This bird is very like a bustard, and is known
to Anglo-Indian sportsmen as the <i>Bustard-Florican</i>.
It is an ashy-brown bird, each
feather having a blackish streak down the
shaft. Its wings and tail have some black and
white bars, which are conspicuous when the
bird flies. The bill, eyes, and feet are yellow.
Its wild-sounding cry, which is often heard
at night, is like that of the curlew.</p>
<p>It frequents dry, open, stony country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Ja&ccedil;anas, 181 and 182</i></h3>
<p>These remarkable birds have very long toes, which enable them to run about on the large
floating leaves of water plants.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_181">181</a>. <i>Metopidius indicus</i>: The Bronze-winged
Ja&ccedil;ana. (F. 1428), (J. 900), (-IV.)</p>
<p>Head, neck, and breast a beautiful glossy black. A conspicuous white eyebrow. There
is some black in the wings, but the general hue of these is a metallic greenish bronze.
The lower back and tail are chestnut red.</p>
<p>Rare in Western India; common in the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They present,&rdquo; writes Cunningham, &ldquo;an odd appearance on the wing, owing to the disproportionate
size of their feet, which becomes particularly conspicuous when the legs are
dropped just before the bird pitches on the surface of the weeds and expands its toes,
which have been gathered up into a bundle during flight.&rdquo;</p>

with a tail a foot in length in the breeding
season.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p><i>Winter plumage</i>: Upper parts brown, with a conspicuous white eyebrow and a yellow
band down each side of the neck. Wings black and white. Lower parts white with a black
gorget across the breast. Tail feathers white, except the two median ones, which are brown.</p>
<p><i>Breeding plumage</i>: A long black pheasant-like
tail is assumed, and the other parts are
black, save the head, throat, and wings, which
are white, and the back of the neck, which is
golden yellow. This Ja&ccedil;ana looks in breeding
plumage (i.e. in the summer) rather like a
silver pheasant, and, indeed, Europeans call it
the water-pheasant. It is a beautiful creature
in its summer splendour. Finn says that it is
to his mind &ldquo;the most beautiful of all our
smaller aquatic birds, and hardly equalled in
this respect by any bird whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its peculiar wailing cry has been likened to the mew of a kitten.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Lapwings</i>, 183 <i>and</i> 184</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_183">183</a>. <i>Sarcogrammus indicus</i>: The Red-wattled Lapwing. (F. 1431), (J. 855), (+IV.)</p>
<p>This is the familiar &ldquo;Did-you-do-it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Head, neck, and upper breast black. There is a broad white band running from the eye
down the whole length of the neck. The back and wings are bronzy brown, black, and white,
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
the white being arranged so as to form a conspicuous bar during flight. Lower parts are
white, as is the tail, except for a black band which runs across it near the tip. The bill is
reddish, and there is in front of the eye a conspicuous crimson wattle. The legs are
bright yellow.</p>
<p>This noisy bird is known to all residents in India. Its noisy call, &ldquo;Did he do it? Pity to
do it,&rdquo; is one of the most familiar sounds of the Indian country-side. (Illus. B. B., p. 161.)</p>
<p>In Burma it is replaced by an allied species&mdash;<i>Sarcogrammus
atrinuchalis</i>&mdash;the Burmese Wattled Lapwing.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_184">184</a>. <i>Sarciophorus malabaricus</i>: The Yellow-wattled Lapwing. (F. 1433), (J. 856), (-IV.)</p>
<p>This is very like the last species, the chief difference being that the conspicuous wattle is
yellow instead of crimson and the white line runs round the back of the head from eye to
eye, instead of down the neck. Its cry is like that of No. 183, but not so harsh and with a
note less.</p>
<p>This species is widely distributed, but not usually so common as the last. It is said not to
occur in Upper Sind or the Western Punjab. It certainly does not occur in the neighbourhood
of Lahore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_184a">184a</a>. <i>Hoplopterus ventralis</i>: The Spur-winged Plover. (F. 1435), (J. 857), (IV.)</p>
<p>Wings and tail marked like those of the red-wattled lapwing. The head and recumbent
crest are black. No wattle. Its call is very like that of the yellow-wattled lapwing. This bird
is very common on the Ganges. Not found in the Bombay Presidency, nor in Madras south
of the Godaveri.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Plovers</i>, 185 <i>and</i> 186</h3>
<p>The ringed plovers are small &ldquo;snippets&rdquo; which haunt the seashore and the sandbanks of
rivers. They go about in small flocks. Numbers of them are to be seen on the muddy edges
of the Coum at Madras, but they have to be looked for, since from a little distance they
assimilate closely to the hue of the mudbanks on which they disport themselves. They are
not much bigger than sparrows, but are pretty little birds. Two species are common.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_185">185</a>. <i>&AElig;gialitis alexandrina</i>: The Kentish
Plover. (F. 1446), (J. 848), (I.)</p>
<p>Upper parts brown, lower parts white. The brown of the upper parts is broken by a white
forehead, eyebrow, and collar. The under surface of the wing is white, so that as a flock
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
of this species or the next two species fly they look now brown, now white, according as the
brown or white surface of the wing is presented to the observer.</p>
<p>This species is seen chiefly in winter and on the sea-coast.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_186">186</a>. <i>&AElig;gialitis dubia</i>: The Little Ringed Plover. (F. 1447), (J. 850), (I.)</p>
<p>This is very like No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_185">185</a> in appearance, but may be easily distinguished from it by having
a black band across the throat. Legs yellow.</p>
<p>This species is not confined to the sea-coast. Like most of its tribe it has a plaintive whistle.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_187">187</a>. <i>Himantopus candidus</i>: The Black-winged Stilt, or Long-legs. (F. 1451), (J. 898), (-IV.)</p>
<p><i>Male</i>: A white bird with glossy black back and wings.</p>
<p><i>Female</i>: White with brown back and wings.</p>
<p>This species is characterised by very long red legs. Its bill is nearly three inches long.</p>
<p>It is found in marshes and tanks.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_188">188</a>. <i>Recurvirostra avocetta</i>: The Avocet. (F. 1452), (J. 899), (IV.)</p>
<p>This elegant bird is characterised by a very long bill, which is curved <i>upwards</i> towards
the end. It is a very easy bird to identify.
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Its body is about the size of that of the crow. It is a white bird with a number of black markings.
The black markings are on top of the head, back of the neck, the shoulders, and the
wings. The beak is black and the long legs are dark grey.</p>
<p>Wherever there is shallow water there may the avocet be found wading in winter, for it
is only a winter visitor to India. It does not appear to be very common anywhere.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Curlews</i>, 189 <i>and</i> 190</h3>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_189">189</a>. <i>Numenius arquata</i>: The Curlew. (F. 1454), (J. 877), (V.)</p>
<p>This well-known bird is about the size of a kite, and except for the white chin and throat
its colouring is rather like that of the kite. But here all resemblance to the kite ceases.
The curlew is a long-shanked wading bird, with a curved bill half a foot in length, the curve in
this case being downwards instead of upwards as in the avocet. It has a wild, plaintive cry.</p>
<p>It is a winter visitor to India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_190">190</a>. <i>Numenius ph&aelig;opus</i>: The Whimbrel.
(F. 1455), (J. 878), (+IV; about midway between the crow and the kite.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>This is a small edition of the curlew, but differs from it in having a white band along the
middle of the head. Its curved bill is only a little over three inches long. It is less abundant
than the curlew, and perhaps scarcely deserves a place among the common birds of India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_191">191</a>. <i>Limosa belgica</i>: The Black-tailed Godwit. (F. 1456), (J. 875), (-V.)</p>
<p>A brown bird with white chin, throat, and abdomen, and some white in the wings. The
base of the tail is white and the remainder black. The bill is about four inches long, and
straight. The legs are long.</p>
<p>A winter visitor to India; common in the north and rare in the south.</p>
<p>Blanford states that it is often sold in the Calcutta bazaar as woodcock, but Finn states
that this is not in accordance with his experience. (Illus. I. G. III., p. 409.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Sandpipers</i>, 192-195</h3>
<p>These birds constitute the &ldquo;snippets&rdquo; of Anglo-Indian, that is to say, birds that try to
be snipe.</p>
<p>These are all greenish-brown birds with light under parts. They have fairly long bills,
but not so long as that of any of the species of snipe. They are often seen feeding&mdash;a statement
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
which cannot be made regarding the snipe. If you see a snipe-like bird feeding,
you may be perfectly sure that it is not a snipe. It is a sandpiper of sorts, but it is not
by any means easy to say which of the many sandpipers without shooting it. Descriptions
of the common species of sandpiper follow:&mdash;</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_192">192</a>. <i>Totanus hypoleucus</i>: The Common Sandpiper. (F. 1460), (J. 893), (+II, but
with a very short tail, so that it actually measures less than a bulbul.)</p>
<p>It is a greenish-brown bird with white under parts. Its legs are not long for a wader;
its bill is about an inch long. It goes about in ones or twos (never in flocks), picking up insects
on the water&rsquo;s edge. When disturbed it flies away, and then its wings, which are
pointed, show a very narrow white band. By this you may recognise the species. It flies
low, and as Eha remarks, with its wings bent like a bow. When it settles down it wags its
apology for a tail in wagtail-like manner. (Illus. B. B., p. 168.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_193">193</a>. <i>Totanus glareola</i>: The Wood Sandpiper, or Spotted Sandpiper. (F. 1461), (J. 891), (+II, but with a very short tail.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>The upper plumage of this is dark brown spotted with white. The abdomen is white, as
is also the tail.</p>
<p>The habits of this species are very like those of the snipe, so that the sportsman out shooting
constantly puts up the bird, but it can be distinguished from the snipe, because instead
of emitting the sharp &ldquo;<i>psip</i>&rdquo; of the snipe on rising, it utters a shrill note. Moreover, it is
a much smaller bird than even the Jack-snipe.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_194">194</a>. <i>Totanus ochropus</i>: The Green Sandpiper. (F. 1462), (J. 892), (+II, but with a
short tail.)</p>
<p>This bird is very like the last species, except that it is larger and less conspicuously spotted,
and has more white in the tail. It is distinguishable from the snipe, alongside of which it
is often found, by its &ldquo;shrill piping note,&rdquo; which it utters on the wing, and its white tail,
which is conspicuous as it flies away.</p>
<p>A winter visitor; commoner in N. India than in the south.</p>
<p>Among the sandpipers that visit India during
the winter in large numbers are (1) <i>Totanus
glottis</i>: The Greenshank. (F. 1466), (J. 894),
(-IV) and (2) <i>Totanus calidris</i>: The Redshank.
(F. 1464), (J. 897), (+III). The greenshank
may be recognised by its large size and
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
the redshank by the red legs, which are not so
extravagantly long as those of the stilt (187).</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_195">195</a>. <i>Tringa minuta</i>: The Little Stint. (F.
1471), (J. 884), (+I, but with a short tail.)</p>
<p>Upper parts dingy brown, with white forehead and under parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; writes Eha, &ldquo;you see a hundred dingy little birds, about the size of sparrows, all
feeding together knee-deep in water, you may safely put them down as stints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A winter visitor to India; common on the coasts.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Snipes</i></h3>
<p>These being game birds are not dealt with
in this volume. It must suffice that all four
species&mdash;The Common, Full, or Fantail Snipe
(<i>Gallinago c&oelig;lestis</i>), The Pintail (<i>G. stenura</i>),
The Little Jack-Snipe (<i>G. gallinula</i>), and The
Painted Snipe (<i>Rostratula capensis</i>), who is not
a true snipe, all lie up closely in marshy ground
or paddy fields in the daytime, and are not
likely to be seen by the naturalist unless he is
prepared to wade and flush them.</p>
<p>When flushed the first three go off at a great
pace, either uttering no call or a short, sharp
&ldquo;<i>psip</i>.&rdquo; The flight of the last species is comparatively
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
feeble. (Illus. I. G. III., pp. 339, 359, etc.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Gulls</i>, 196-199</h3>
<p>Gulls are very familiar birds to every one who has performed the journey from England
to India. The beautiful flight and the loud screams of these kites of the sea are indelibly
impressed upon the memory of most Anglo-Indians.</p>
<p>These magnificent fliers are able to keep pace with the steamer for hours at a time without
putting forth any effort. They saunter through the air in the wake of the ship, and when anything
edible is thrown overboard they drop down and pick it off the water (they can swim
like ducks), and having devoured what there is to be eaten, they fly on after the ship, and catch
up in a few seconds.</p>
<p>They are largely scavengers. At sea-coast stations no sight is more familiar than that of
a number of crows and gulls squabbling over the little fish, etc., that the fishermen throw
away when overhauling their nets on the seashore. (Illus. B. D., p. 272; also B. B., p. 190.)</p>
<p>The four commonest gulls in India are:</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_196">196</a>. <i>Larus ridibundus</i>: The Laughing Gull. (F. 1490), (J. 891), (IV.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>A white bird with grey shoulders and some black in the wings. In summer the head and
neck become brown and in winter traces of this usually remain. The bill and legs are red.</p>
<p>A winter visitor to India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_197">197</a>. <i>Larus brunneicephalus</i>: The Brown-headed Gull. (F. 1491), (J. 980), (+IV.)</p>
<p>This bird is very like the last at all seasons, so that it is scarcely possible to distinguish them
on the wing.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_198">198</a>. <i>Larus affinis</i>: The Dark-backed Herring-Gull. (F. 1494), (J. 978), (V.)</p>
<p>This bird is distinguished from Nos. <a class="rb" href="#bird_196">196</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_197">197</a> by the fact that its wings and shoulders are
slate-grey instead of pale grey, and its legs are yellow. It is a much larger bird than the above
two species.</p>
<p>It is said to be very common at Karachi. It is found on other parts of the West Coast,
but apparently not on the East Coast.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_199">199</a>. <i>Larus cachinans</i>: The Yellow-legged Herring-Gull. (F. 1495), (V.)</p>
<p>This is very like No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_198">198</a>, except that its shoulders are of a lighter shade of grey. It has
yellow legs.</p>
<p>This gull is often seen on the rivers and large <i>jhils</i> of Northern India in winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Terns</i>, 200-205</h3>
<p>These beautiful birds have been aptly termed the swallows of the sea, for like swallows they
are birds of powerful flight, and remain for long periods on the wing. But they are not confined
to the sea. In India, wherever there are rivers, <i>jhils</i>, or ponds there are terns to be found.</p>
<p>Their prevailing colour is white, and most of them have some black in their plumage.</p>
<p>To repeat what I said in <i>Bombay Ducks</i>: &ldquo;No one can fail to recognise a tern. If you see a
slenderly-built bird of whitish tinge, with long swallow-like wings and forked tail, a bird which
sails along easily over water, sometimes diving for a fish, more frequently picking something
off the surface of the water, you may set that bird down as a tern.&rdquo; (Illus. B. D., p. 270.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_200">200</a>. <i>Hydrochelidon hybrida</i>: The Whiskered Tern, or the Small Marsh Tern. (F. 1496), (J. 984), (+II.)</p>
<p><i>Winter plumage</i>: A white bird with grey back, wings, and tail. Some black on the nape
of the neck and a black streak behind the eye. Bill, legs, and toes dull red.</p>
<p><i>Summer plumage</i>: The whole of the upper
part of the head is black. The abdomen becomes
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
dark grey, so that at this season the whiskered tern is liable to be confounded with
the black-bellied tern (<a class="rb" href="#bird_204">204</a>). The tail, however, of the whiskered species is not so deeply forked.</p>
<p>Very common in N. India. An inland bird found on marshes, rivers, tanks, and paddy fields.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_201">201</a>. <i>Hydroprogne caspia</i>: The Caspian Tern. (F. 1498), (J. 982), (+IV.)</p>
<p>This is the largest of the terns. It is a white bird save for the fact that there is a good deal
of black in the head. Its wings are pearl grey. Its bill is bright red. Its legs are black. Its tail
is not very deeply forked. It goes about in pairs. It is local in its distribution.</p>
<p>It is common at Madras, and it is said to be particularly common in Sind. I have never
seen it in the Punjab. Eha does not mention it as one of the birds of Bombay.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_202">202</a>. <i>Sterna angelica</i>: The Gull-billed Tern. (F. 1499), (J. 983), (+III, with a longish tail.)</p>
<p>Printer&rsquo;s devils are particularly spiteful to this bird. In <i>The Common Birds of Bombay</i>
they have mutilated its name into &ldquo;gull-gilled.&rdquo; In <i>Bombay Ducks</i> it appears as the
&ldquo;gull-bird tern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the least beautiful of the terns, being more heavily built than most of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>In winter it is a white bird with grey wings and some black in the head. In summer its
head is jet black. The bill, legs, and feet are black. Its tail is not very deeply forked.</p>
<p>It is found both inland and on the coast.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_203">203</a>. <i>Sterna seena</i>: The Indian River Tern. (F. 1503), (J. 985), (+III, with a long, deeply
forked tail.)</p>
<p>This is the common tern of N. India, and frequents all the large rivers.</p>
<p>Its head and nape are deep black. The upper plumage French grey. Lower plumage very
pale grey. Chin white, and a white patch on each cheek. Bill bright deep yellow. Legs red.
This bird moults about Christmas time, and for a few weeks after the moult there is much
white in the head, but this soon disappears.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_204">204</a>. <i>Sterna melanogaster</i>: The Black-bellied Tern. (F. 1504), (J. 987), (-III, but with a
long, deeply forked tail.)</p>
<p>Head black (with some white after the moult at Christmas), <i>abdomen black</i>. Cheek, chin-throat,
and wing lining white. Rest of plum, age grey, paler on the tail than on the back.
Bill orange-yellow; legs and feet dull red.</p>
<p>One of the commonest of the terns, especially inland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_205">205</a>. <i>Sterna minuta</i>: The Little Tern. (F. 1510), (J. 988), (-II.)</p>
<p>A tern not much bigger than a sparrow, with a white forehead and black head, white cheeks
and lower parts, grey wings, dark red bill and legs, is probably this species.</p>
<p>It is fairly common in N. India; rare in the south.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_206">206</a>. <i>Rhynchops albicollis</i>: The Indian Skimmer, or Scissors-bill. (F. 1517), (J. 995),
(-IV.)</p>
<p>A long-winged, tern-like bird, which flies about in little flocks a few inches above the surface
of the water, with white forehead, tail, and lower parts, and a white collar round the neck;
rest of upper plumage dark brown. Bill deep red; legs bright red. (Illus. F. IV., p. 296.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Pelicans</i>, 207 <i>and</i> 208</h3>
<p>Description of these well-known birds is superfluous, as every one knows what they look
like.</p>
<p>Four species are found in India, but they can scarcely be described as common birds.
Two species, however, are fairly abundant on the big <i>jhils</i> of Northern India.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_207">207</a>. <i>Pelicanus crispus</i>: The Dalmatian
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Pelican. (F. 1522), (+V; a large bird as big as a swan.)</p>
<p>The beak is one and a half feet in length. A white bird with some black in the wings.
Bill dark grey.</p>
<p>Winter visitor to U. P. and Sind. (Illus. F. IV., p. 331.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_208">208</a>. <i>Pelicanus philippensis</i>: The Spotted-billed
or Grey Pelican. (F. 1523), (J. 1004),
(+V; much smaller than <a class="rb" href="#bird_207">207</a>.)</p>
<p>This may be distinguished by the curious dark spots and markings on its pinkish yellow
bill. (Illus. B. P., frontispiece.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Cormorants</i>, 209-211</h3>
<p>These are large black birds, which live
largely on the water, and catch fish by diving.
When not fishing they have the habit of standing
on top of a post with wings outspread and
then look rather like a church lectern.</p>
<p>Three species occur in India:</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_209">209</a>. <i>Phalacrocorax carbo</i>: The Large Cormorant.
(F. 1526), (J. 1005), (+V.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_210">210</a>. <i>Phalacrocorax fuscicollis</i>: The Indian
Shag. (F. 1527), (J. 1006), (+V, but smaller
than 209.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_211">211</a>. <i>Phalacrocorax javanicus</i>: The Little
Cormorant. (F. 1528), (J. 1007), (IV.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>All three have similar habits, the last being
the only common member of the genus. No.
<a class="rb" href="#bird_210">210</a> has no white throat. Nos. <a class="rb" href="#bird_209">209</a> and <a class="rb" href="#bird_211">211</a>
have a white throat, but can be readily distinguished
by the fact that No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_209">209</a> is one foot
longer than No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_211">211</a>.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Ibises</i>, 212-214</h3>
<p>Ibises are birds about the size of a common
fowl, but having a long curved bill like that of
the curlew. As Finn has pointed out, &ldquo;Ibises
fly like storks with the neck outstretched, but
with a quicker stroke of the wings and frequent
intervals of sailing with the pinions held level,
so that they are easily distinguished from other
waders when on the wing.&rdquo; They usually occur
in small flocks.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_212">212</a>. <i>Ibis melanocephala</i>: The White Ibis.
(F. 1541), (J. 941), (+V.)</p>
<p>The bald head and neck are black, as are the
long bill and legs. The rest of the plumage is
white.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_213">213</a>. <i>Inocotis papillosus</i>: The Black Ibis.
(F. 1542), (J. 942), (+V.)</p>
<p>The Black Curlew, or King Curlew, or King
Ibis of Anglo-Indians.</p>
<p>In this species the head only, and not the
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
neck as in No. <a class="rb" href="#bird_212">212</a>, is devoid of feathers. The
skin is black, but the back of the head is covered
with little red warts. The plumage is glossy
black, save for a small white patch on the wing.
The bill, which is nearly six inches long, is dull
dark green. Legs bright red.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_214">214</a>. <i>Plegadis falcinellus</i>: The Glossy Ibis.
(F. 1544), (J. 943), (+V.)</p>
<p>In this species only the front of the face is
devoid of feathers. A chestnut bird with head,
wings, and tail dark brown with a green gloss.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_215">215</a>. <i>Platalea leucorodia</i>: The Spoonbill. (F. 1545), (J. 939), (+V.)</p>
<p>A large white bird with a crest in the breeding
season. The long bill, which is flat and
expanded at the end like a spoon, is black, as
are the long legs. It is impossible to mistake
spoonbills. There are no other birds like them.
They are found in small flocks on sandbanks,
etc., at the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Storks</i>, 216-221</h3>
<p>Every one is familiar with the appearance
of the common stork. The leading features of
the stork family are their large size, their long
legs, neck, and bill, and their perching habits.
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
In this last respect they differ from cranes,
which never perch in trees. During flight
their long necks are stretched out forwards, and
their long legs stretched out backwards. They
fly by a slow, steady flapping of the wings, but
often sail on outstretched wings like vultures.
Their nests are in India, huge platforms of
sticks built in trees.</p>

<p>This huge bird is characterised by an enormous
beak, over a foot in length, and a head
devoid of feathers. From its neck hangs a
pouch. There is a ruff of white feathers round
the neck. The lower parts are white. The
wings are partly dark slaty grey and partly
French grey. The bill is dirty pink, and the
legs dirty greyish white.</p>
<p>Not found in S. India. (Illus. B. P., pp. 28

<p>This is a stork which is trying to turn into

having a marked downward curve. It is a
white bird with a black band across the breast.
The wings are mainly black, but some of the

<p>This bird is distinguished from all others by
the fact that the mandibles do not meet in the
middle; indeed the beak looks as though it had
become distorted owing to the attempts of
the bird to crack a very hard nut! (The head
is figured on p. 378, F. IV.) It is a greyish
white bird with black shoulders, wings, and
tail. The bill is light horn colour, and the
legs dirty pink.</p>
<p>To my mind this bird looks like a white
stork that sadly needs a wash and brush up
and its beak put straight!</p>
<p>Found only in N. India. Abundant in
Oudh and Bengal.</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Herons</i>, 222-225</h3>
<p>Herons are wading birds with long, sharp,
stiletto-like bills and telescopic necks. It is
their habit to stand motionless in shallow
water with the head almost buried on the
shoulders. When a victim shows itself, out
shoots the neck of the fisher, and woe betide
his victim! On the wing herons are easily
identified by their large size, the steady flapping
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
of their wings, and the fact that they fly
with the neck drawn in and the legs projecting
behind beyond the tail. A great many species
of heron occur in India, but only four are
commonly seen by the average observer.</p>

head. From the back of the head some black
plumes hang. Lower parts white. Bill dark

<p>Usually a solitary bird.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_223">223</a>. <i>Bubulcus coromandus</i>: The Cattle Egret.
(F. 1562), (J. 929), (+IV.)</p>
<p>A pure white bird with a yellow bill and
black legs. In the breeding season some yellow
plumes grow from the back of the head.</p>
<p>This is a sociable species. These birds frequently
accompany cattle, which serve as
efficient beaters. The quadrupeds put up
grasshoppers, etc., which the egrets seize. The
birds sometimes perch on the backs of cattle.</p>
<p>There are three larger species of egret which
are also white; these belong to the genus
<i>Herodias</i>, but these are scarcely common birds.
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
A large white egret with the bill black is one
of these species. (Illus. B. D., p. 240.)</p>

This is the ubiquitous Paddy Bird. (F. 1565),
(J. 930), (+IV.)</p>
<p>This bird, which may be seen squatting at
the margin of every tank and every village
pond, looks greenish brown&mdash;much the colour
of its muddy surroundings. But startle it and
it opens out milk-white wings on which it flies
away with steady flappings. It is impossible
to mistake a paddy bird. It sits all brown and
flies all white. Close inspection shows that
every feather has the shaft of a colour different
from the web. (Illus. B. D., p. 236; also
B. P., p. 114; also B. P., p. 178.)</p>

<p>The head, nape, back, and shoulders are
black. Forehead, cheek, breast, and lower parts
white. Remainder of plumage ashy grey. Eyes
bright red. Some of the feathers of the back of

plumes. (Illus. B. D., pp. 232 and 238.)</p>

<p>These beautiful birds occur in flocks in
shallow lakes. They are white with a pink
tinge. The wings are white, black, and cerise.
The long legs are deep pink. The curious beak
is bent in the middle to form an obtuse angle.
(The beak is figured on p. 408 of Vol. IV. of
O. and B. B.)</p>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Geese</i>, 227 <i>and</i> 228</h3>
<p>As geese are game birds they do not come
strictly within the scope of this book. However,
as these birds are much <i>en evidence</i> in
Upper India in the cold weather, I will briefly
describe the two common species.</p>
<p>In the U. P. during the winter months no
sight is more common than that of a V-shaped
flock of geese cleaving its way through the air
on quivering wings. The birds, as they fly,
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
utter a curious cackle easy to recognise, but
difficult to describe. This call is often heard
at night. When riding in the early morning
one often surprises a flock of geese feeding in
some field. They pass the day on a sandbank
in some large river, most of the flock asleep on
one leg with heads tucked under the wing, but
one or two birds are invariably posted as
sentinels.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_227">227</a>. <i>Anser ferus</i>: The Grey-lag Goose.
(F. 1579), (J. 945), (V.)</p>
<p>Upper parts brown, the shoulders having a
number of narrow pale cross bars. Lower
parts pale grey. Bill, legs, and feet are a dirty
pink colour.</p>
<p>Not found in S. India. (Illus. I. G. III.,
p. 55.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_228">228</a>. <i>Anser indicus</i>: The Barred-headed
Goose. (F. 1583), (J. 949), (-V.)</p>
<p>This species is distinguished from the other by its yellow bill and feet, and the fact that its
head is white with two conspicuous broad black cross bars, from which the bird derives its name.
Its general colour is more grey than that of the last species.</p>
<p>Rare in S. India. (Illus. I. D., p. 84; also I. G. III., p. 81.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<h3 class="genus"><i>The Ducks</i>, 229 <i>and</i> 230</h3>
<p>These being game birds do not come within the scope of this work. Two species, however,
which are commonly seen are not usually shot by sportsmen on account of their indifferent
flavour. These I describe.</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_229">229</a>. <i>Casarca rutila</i>: The Ruddy Sheldrake, or Brahminy Duck. (F. 1588), (J. 954), (-V.)</p>
<p>This is a curious pale ruddy-brown bird, whitish on the head. Tail and wings black.
Bill, legs, and feet blackish.</p>
<p>This handsome duck is a winter visitor to India. It is very abundant in N. India, less
abundant in S. India, not being found at all on the Malabar coast. It invariably goes about in
pairs, which dwell in rivers rather than in tanks. They are wary birds and a great
nuisance to sportsmen, since they warn other water-fowl of danger. &ldquo;It is difficult,&rdquo; writes
Blanford, &ldquo;so long as one is on an Indian river to get out of sight of these birds or out of
hearing of their peculiar clanging bi-syllabic call or alarm cry, which is uttered frequently
on the smallest excuse.&rdquo; The cry is like a soft &ldquo;<i>chakwa</i>,&rdquo; hence the Hindustani name of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
bird. (Illus. I. D., p. 114; also I. G. III., p. 123.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_230">230</a>. <i>Spatula clypeata</i>: The Shoveller. (F. 1602), (J. 957), (-V.)</p>
<p>This handsome duck, although it occurs in
<i>jhils</i>, is pre-eminently a village duck. If there
be any considerable piece of stagnant water
near a village in N. India, there are likely to
be some shoveller ducks on this&mdash;in winter,
for they are only winter visitors to India.
This species is distinguishable from other
ducks by its great flat bill being much broader
at the tip than at the base. It has a peculiar
habit of swimming in circles with its bill resting
on the surface of the water.</p>
<p><i>Cock, after February</i>: Head and upper neck
glossy green. Lower neck and breast white.
Abdomen chestnut. Rest of body brown with
a green patch or speculum in the wing.</p>
<p><i>Cock before February, and Hen</i>: Reddish
brown with a lighter-coloured border to many
of the feathers. (Illus. I. D., p. 196; also I. G.
III., p. 141.)</p>
<p><a class="db" id="bird_231">231</a>. <i>Podicipes albipennis</i>: The Indian Little Grebe, or Dabchick. (F. 1617), (J. 975), (+II.)</p>
<p>This is one of the most aquatic birds in existence. It rarely walks on <i>terra firma</i>, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
never takes to flight from the water. When alarmed it seeks safety by diving. Writing of
this bird, Eha says, &ldquo;I do not know how to describe it better than to say that you might
take it for a small chicken without a tail. Its colour is dark glossy brown on the upper
parts, with some rich chestnut on the sides of the neck. Young birds are lighter.&rdquo; (Illus.
B. B., p. 184.)</p>
